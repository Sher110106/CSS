Just wanted to share my experience with semaglutide (Ozempic/Wegovy) after 4 months on it. I’ve seen a lot of questions about what to expect, how it feels, and whether it’s “worth it,” so here’s my honest rundown:

**Stats:**

* Starting weight: 238 lbs
* Current weight: 198 lbs
* Height: 5'7""
* Total loss: 40 lbs
* Time on sema: \~17 weeks (up to 1.7mg)

**What’s helped the most:**

* **Appetite reduction is REAL.** I used to constantly think about food. Now I have to remind myself to eat sometimes.
* **Portion control finally feels natural.** Half my old meal fills me up now.
* **No more binge cravings.** This was HUGE for me. It’s like my brain quieted down.
* **Weight loss is steady, not fast.** Around 2–3 lbs/week average. Some weeks were slower.

**Side effects I experienced:**

* Mild nausea the first couple of days after increasing dose
* Occasional fatigue
* Some constipation, but manageable with hydration + fiber

**Tips:**

* Eat slow, chew well — you’ll feel full faster
* Stay hydrated, especially during early weeks
* Don’t rely *only* on the med — some light movement really helps
* Use the momentum to build better habits (meal prep, journaling, etc.)

I’ve still got a way to go, but for the first time in YEARS I feel like I’m in control again.

Happy to answer any questions or hear how others are doing too — it’s really motivating seeing everyone’s stories here. 💪",179,58,2025-05-23T08:18:58,Ozempic,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ozempic/comments/1kt92cg/semaglutide_weight_loss_4_months_in_heres_what/,0.98,True,/r/Ozempic/comments/1kt92cg/semaglutide_weight_loss_4_months_in_heres_what/,2025-10-27T18:52:37.173912,"Semaglutide Weight Loss - 4 Months In, Here’s What I’ve Learned Hey everyone,

1o2c1dk,Foreign_Language_706,"One year on semaglutide, 77 lbs down, but the real change was my life 🫶","I'm feeling so grateful and proud of myself in this moment, so I wanted to share my story in case it helps even one person who’s just starting, curious, or feeling unsure, because I was totally there, reading posts like this, wondering if I’d ever really change.

But I did it.

I officially hit one full year on my weight loss journey while on semaglutide, and I almost don’t recognize the person I was back then. When I started, I was around 310–320 lbs, and I was tired in ways I didn’t even fully understand. Even sitting sometimes felt like work!

Today I’m sitting at 233 lbs. That’s 77 lbs down!! But even better, I feel alive again.  
I actually have energy. I walk just because it feels good (and because I can). I take stairs without thinking. I can literally breathe easier. I even built a gym routine, and actually enjoy it. (Who even is she??)

For those wondering, semaglutide wasn’t a magic fix, but it gave me something I never had before: quiet.

The food noise that used to scream in my head for years finally turned down. My cravings became super manageable, sometimes even nonexistent. It’s like it gave me a pause button, just enough space to make better choices and build habits that stuck.

I knew losing weight sustainably was going to take time, which always felt daunting and why I would get involved in “get skinny in 10 days” scams in the past. But I just had to try, and do it the healthiest way I could. Looking back, I had a lot more fun than I expected, and some days it almost felt too easy.

Weight loss really comes down to being in a calorie deficit. Once I figured out the range that worked for me, semaglutide saved my life, I was NEVER hungry. Hunger was always the true culprit behind reverting to old habits. This allowed me to just start. I wasn’t perfect, but I figured out how to eat my favorite foods while building a better mindset about portion control. That naturally led to being more mindful about the diet I wanted to maintain: high protein, good fiber, balanced plates.

This medication made my brain content with my choices, it didn’t demand pizza because of a bad day. And as we get older, it can feel tough seeing results, but my efforts always showed up. So wild.

I’ll admit there were plateaus, especially around my monthly cycle, but my body would adjust and continue to release weight. There were some side effects, sulfur burps, some GI stuff early on, but honestly? My body handled it, and symptoms lessened over time. Even at its worst, I’d do it again a hundred times. What I got in return was a bigger, brighter world full of possibilities.

I fit comfortably on planes. I say yes to plans. I flirt again! I laugh more… all the little things that make a huge difference in quality of life that I had sacrificed to my old habits. I feel like I’ve been reintroduced to my own life.

I’m not done, probably another 70 lbs, but I’m so proud of what this year gave me.

If you’re at the beginning, keep going. The small promises you make to yourself add up in ways that will completely change your life. You’ve got this. 💛

156t7ew,trynabeaskinnybitch,The Real Secret Behind Semaglutide! 6lbs in first 2 weeks!,"My healthcare practitioner told me that there could be gastrointestinal side effects with semaglutiide injections. This is apparently the understatement of my most recent memory.  I was given a .25mg titration dose for the first 4 weeks, but was told that if week 1 I didn't notice any adverse affects I could go to .5mg at week 2. This was a cataclysmically bad idea. I am here to encourage you to stay the titration course. 

Week 1 on .25, I noticed an immediate reduction in appetite. Side effects were mild: a little dizzy, a little stomach pain, a little nausea but mostly from adjusting to having an emptier stomach or over eating at night. Heart burn in the morning is a real thing. If you push your night feeding, you're going to regret it the next morning. But only in the way where you feel a little hungover and sludgy when the alarm goes off the next morning. 

Week 2, I chugged up on .5mg. I got cocky. .25 was a breeze. In my rush to a hot girl fall body, I upped the dose. I injected on Sunday on an empty stomach, right after waking up. Everything was fine, but I started feeling 'woozy' that afternoon. By woozy, just a little dizzy/nauseous. 

Monday, I had zero appetite. I had half a cup of Chick fila chicken noodle soup. For dinner I had a protein shake. No milk. 

Tuesday morning, I woke up feeling like I swallowed a bowling ball. I showered with my face pressed against the cold tile wall. I made it to work and stared blankly at excel while feeling the reeling and tossing of the contents of my stomach. Thinking maybe a snack would help, I ate a slice of mango. 

The moment the mango entered my gullet, all hell breaks loose. I barely make it to the parking lot before I begin power puking. That is the only word for it. With the force of a category 5 hurricane, my guts reentered the world in a 3 feet spray over a 180 degree spray pattern. This is Texas at 11am. It is 107 degrees. Mango is flying out of my nose at Mach 4. It was a low point in my life. 

I continued this Olympic regurgitation until I had thrown up everything I had eaten since I was 25. Fairly certain I saw my wedding cake and that margarita from a few vacations back. While shooting calories across my commute back home, I got a mobile IV nurse in route to the house. She double dosed me with Zofran since I had stopped puking and had taken to dry heaving, my bodies attempt to prove it was sorry for every overeating and getting us fat in the first place. 

The vomiting stopped. Everything stopped. And by stopped, I mean the eye of the storm had settled over my bowels. Nary a gurgle commenced for four days. Do you know how weird it is to not fart for four days? I didn't mind it, but it was an odd phenomena. I found myself jiggling my gut around like, ""hello? Is anyone home?""

This miracle shot created horror at the thought of eating. I looked at a bowl of soup like Indiana Jones when he realized he was in the snake pit. Fear. Abject terror. Every swallow brought on the ""is this the bite that releases the cracken again?"" 

Then on Day 6 the dams of hell broke loose at the south end of the river. I have seen small children shit up their back. I had not experienced that as an adult. Until that day. In a public bathroom. 

And that is how I lost 6 lbs in first two weeks of the injections. Am I going to give up? No way. I'm just going to dial that injection back to .25mg and coast through next week without staring down a chicken breast like I'm negotiating with a terrorist. 

Here is to hoping week 3 has less geysers and lava flows. Good luck on your journey! May your ride be smoother than mine.

But only in the way where you feel a little hungover and sludgy when the alarm goes off the next morning. 

Week 2, I chugged up on .5mg. I got cocky. .25 was a breeze. In my rush to a hot girl fall body, I upped the dose. I injected on Sunday on an empty stomach, right after waking up. Everything was fine, but I started feeling 'woozy' that afternoon. By woozy, just a little dizzy/nauseous. 

Monday, I had zero appetite. I had half a cup of Chick fila chicken noodle soup. For dinner I had a protein shake. No milk. 

Tuesday morning, I woke up feeling like I swallowed a bowling ball. I showered with my face pressed against the cold tile wall. I made it to work and stared blankly at excel while feeling the reeling and tossing of the contents of my stomach. Thinking maybe a snack would help, I ate a slice of mango. 

The moment the mango entered my gullet, all hell breaks loose. I barely make it to the parking lot before I begin power puking. That is the only word for it. With the force of a category 5 hurricane, my guts reentered the world in a 3 feet spray over a 180 degree spray pattern. This is Texas at 11am. It is 107 degrees. Mango is flying out of my nose at Mach 4. It was a low point in my life. 

I continued this Olympic regurgitation until I had thrown up everything I had eaten since I was 25. Fairly certain I saw my wedding cake and that margarita from a few vacations back. While shooting calories across my commute back home, I got a mobile IV nurse in route to the house. She double dosed me with Zofran since I had stopped puking and had taken to dry heaving, my bodies attempt to prove it was sorry for every overeating and getting us fat in the first place. 

The vomiting stopped. Everything stopped. And by stopped, I mean the eye of the storm had settled over my bowels. Nary a gurgle commenced for four days. Do you know how weird it is to not fart for four days? I didn't mind it, but it was an odd phenomena. I found myself jiggling my gut around like, ""hello? Is anyone home?""

This miracle shot created horror at the thought of eating. I looked at a bowl of soup like Indiana Jones when he realized he was in the snake pit. Fear. Abject terror. Every swallow brought on the ""is this the bite that releases the cracken again?"" 

Then on Day 6 the dams of hell broke loose at the south end of the river. I have seen small children shit up their back. I had not experienced that as an adult. Until that day. In a public bathroom. 

And that is how I lost 6 lbs in first two weeks of the injections. Am I going to give up? No way. I'm just going to dial that injection back to .25mg and coast through next week without staring down a chicken breast like I'm negotiating with a terrorist. 

Here is to hoping week 3 has less geysers and lava flows. Good luck on your journey! May your ride be smoother than mine.

1ctgnwa,Ok_Confusion_6639,Why am I gaslighting myself re: taking a semaglutide!?,"My doctors keep talking to me about taking a semaglutide because I’m 275 as a 26 y/o female. I keep thinking, “well, I’ve been chubby my whole life, I just should try harder to actually stick to a diet and then maybe the weight will come off.” I have PCOS so losing weight is so hard, but I am also ALWAYS hungry and always craving non-nutrient-dense foods. I keep thinking that other people need these drugs more, and that I’d only be taking it for cosmetic purposes. Meanwhile I’m developing NAFLD and my A1C is up a full point from last year (in the 4s to now 5.3, still good but have a family history of diabetes and I’m getting closer to pre-diabetes territory… again). 

Any advice on the mindset here? 

EDIT: my biggest hesitancies are that I’m still breastfeeding, and want to lose weight to have more kids but then think “well, I’ll probably just put it back on when I stop for pregnancy/breastfeeding again.” My doctor suggested this as a means to lose weight to be able to conceive another baby in due time without having as high of a blood pressure issue risk for another pregnancy like I did last time at 280+.

1fvzkg0,kpmurphy56,Is the Compounded Semaglutide from Hims/Hers Worth it for $400 per month??,"Just did the Hims/Hers questionnaire and it recommended that I go on their GLP-1 drug Compounded Semaglutide. If you pay for a full year up front it's $200, but they also have options for 6 months ($250), 12 weeks ($300), or 4 weeks ($400).

1nyovp0,Adventurous-Map-3863,After 7 weeks of Semaglutide,"Hey y‘all. I started Ozempic 7 weeks ago with 0.25mg, and today I took the 3rd dose of 0.50mg. 
Thought I wanted to share a few things that I have  noticed: 
For reference, F37, 5.5ft, starting weight 176lbs, current: 164 lbs
I started working out and changed my diet 3 years ago, after my mom had a stroke. Started working out 4-5 a week, and focusing on high protein diet. Fast forward 2 years later I had actually gained 15 lbs instead of loosing it, and the advice of “oh it’s probably muscle mass” just was not cutting it for me. I had bloodwork done twice, but everything seemed to be fine, I suspected PCOS, but my medical provider (we are military, Tricare, so it seems like they really just do what’s medically necessary) didn’t see a big problem with it, and I would get a referral. I researched a lot myself, and realized I forgot I have a IUD (mirena) for birth control. After researching, I realized that the IUD might be responsible for my slow and steady weight gain. I am scheduled to have my IUD removed and my tubes tied, but I just didn’t want to wait any longer. I went online and got semaglutide prescribed, and I actually really love it. 7 weeks in, I have lost 12 lbs so far.
My highlights so far: 
- food cravings are gone, I actually struggle to get enough protein in
- I stopped smoking, I planned stopping long time ago, but I’m disgusted by even the thought of it
- I have no more desire in going out to restaurants, which helps my wallet as well 
- I don’t buy random shit in the grocery store, I am sticking to my list
- I stick to my meal prep. Ordering lunch at work seems like “not worth it” anymore 
- last thing I realized today: I seem to have no desire to go shopping. I might have had a slight shopping addiction, but the random “let’s go to Target or the mall to just look” have completely stopped. Again, good for my wallet. 
- besides headaches in the first couple weeks of taking it, and a little nausea when drinking coffee, no side effects 

Other things I noticed: 
- I lost a bit of drive going to the gym 
- I feel I’m quicker exhausted at the gym
- I don’t think I’ve ever lost that much weight that quick, so I’m afraid my skin starts sagging 
- I’m afraid I’m loosing muscle mass. Thinking about adding in creatine, but when I tried creatine in the past, I gained 10-15 lbs immediately. So im afraid to try it again. 
- the first 4-5 weeks I couldn’t drink coffee, but it seems to be fine the last 2 weeks

1eqkxbz,RangerOk2016,I'm only 26 with no health issues other than being obese. Is it ethical/ok to be on semaglutide/ozempic for life?

There wasn’t any inflammation but there are gallstones so I’m going to speak to a surgeon to see what I need to do. But my question is has this happen to anyone else?

1lrg23j,Commercial_Phone3424,Unfortunately semaglutide not working.,"Compounded Semaglutide not losing weight only felt the side effects on the third day with 0,5, I am in the third week with 1.0 but still feeling the food noise and although I thought I ate so much less than I used to, I have been gaining half a pound weekly. Cutted sugar, bought vegetable, eating protein. Not doing exercise though, I have trigeminal neuralgia, is summer, the sun light hurts my face, but I have been lifting weights at home (Could do better) but I am 90 percent sure my calorie intake is reduced drastically

The third and fourth day with 0.5 I could never finish my plate (not feeling nauseous but just couldn't finish, so I have been trained to put less and less food. I have made soup to be able to eat. I am eating fruits, vegetable, carbs for sure from vegetable, protein like mostly chicken breast.

Feeling worse stomach pain. I already suffer with bad reflux, always have water and pepto bismol to relieve the constant heartburn. After this compound semaglutide have been a little worse. I started taking Omeprazole.

Cutted sugar, bought vegetable, eating protein. Not doing exercise though, I have trigeminal neuralgia, is summer, the sun light hurts my face, but I have been lifting weights at home (Could do better) but I am 90 percent sure my calorie intake is reduced drastically

The third and fourth day with 0.5 I could never finish my plate (not feeling nauseous but just couldn't finish, so I have been trained to put less and less food. I have made soup to be able to eat. I am eating fruits, vegetable, carbs for sure from vegetable, protein like mostly chicken breast.

Feeling worse stomach pain. I already suffer with bad reflux, always have water and pepto bismol to relieve the constant heartburn. After this compound semaglutide have been a little worse. I started taking Omeprazole.

112epc6,MysteriousResult2876,Compounded Semaglutide. Discuss…?,"I’ve recently discovered that Med Spas, Plastic Surgeons, etc are starting to offer in-office weekly Semaglutide weight loss programs. Im in Southern California so there are a lot of them here. The place I spoke to will charge $75 per injection up to 2 mg. They specifically advertised that it is not Ozempic and does not impact the supply shortage affecting diabetics. It comes in a vial and they inject you with a needle like botox or a vaccine. The drug is not from Novo Nordisk; it is made by a compounding pharmacy. and this doctor told me to get around the patent/legality, the pharmacy compounds it with vitamin B12, therefore making it a different drug. But with the same effect. I am skeptical.  I found some articles online warning doctors against prescribing these compounded drugs because it’s unclear where the semaglutide even comes from and if it’s a different form of a semaglutide “salt” which could have different therapeutic levels.

I think this is interesting particularly the legality of it and the fact that it apparently doesn’t impact the shortages of the “pens.” I’m curious to hear if you guys have heard of this or have experience with it. Perhaps this method is appropriate for the medspa patient who is not majorly overweight, where the risk of potency and accuracy isn’t as serious as it could be to a diabetic or somebody treating morbid obesity. 

I’ve been getting my Ozempic pens from a Canadian pharmacy and it’s costing $380 now so this would be more cost effective for me. I’m not sure I want to take the plunge lol.

1m2ins3,Otherwise-Egg-1511,"I did a 6+ month micro-taper off semaglutide (from 1 mg/week to 0) using the ""click method"" – no weight regain. Has anyone else tried this?","I wanted to share a tapering method I used to come off semaglutide (Ozempic) very slowly and with full weight maintenance – no bounce-back, no hunger surge. I haven’t seen this level of precision discussed yet, so maybe it helps someone.


---

Baseline:

Weekly dose: 1 mg/week, split into two 0.5 mg injections per week.

I used the pen’s click increments to taper down extremely slowly.



---

Tapering method:

I started with 2×38 clicks/week (≈1 mg total).

Then I reduced total weekly dose by 2 clicks per month, meaning:

2×36 clicks/week for 1 month,

then 2×34/week for 1 month,

and so on...


I went all the way down to 2×26 clicks/week (~0.68 mg total), then stopped completely.

So the taper lasted ~6 months, total dose drop of ~32%.



---

My context:

I'm male, mid-30s, 180 cm (5'11""), started at 134 kg, reached 89 kg over time.

Daily steps: 12k+, training: 3× strength + 2× sprinting per week.

Diet: Clean, high-protein (~180 g/day), mostly low-carb/keto.

No major cravings, stable blood sugar, regular tracking.



---

Result:

Zero weight regain after stopping.

Hunger didn’t spike, I didn’t ""feel the drop"" because it was so slow.

I think the body adapted naturally while lifestyle took over.

I never saw this discussed in literature or Reddit – anyone else try a ""click taper""?



---

Why I’m posting: Most people stop cold turkey or reduce by mg steps (1.0 → 0.5 → 0.25). I believe microtapering via clicks might prevent the typical rebound. If you’ve tried something similar – or want to – let’s compare notes.

1kxzlej,itsatumbleweed,Anyone switch from Tirzepatide to Semaglutide?,"I'm currently on Zepbound and losing approx. 2 lbs per week with no noticable side effects.

There are enough Semaglutide success stories that I'm not totally heartbroken. However, it is kind of disheartening that people who have a medication that is working have to change to a different compound for what amounts to a business decision. But I figured I'd check and see what the common experience was- did you keep your appetite under control at the same pace? Did the effects drop off? Any new side effects? Any small ones go away? 

I also have sleep apnea, which Zepbound is approved for while Wegovy is not. I also sought out a GLP-1 agonist because I'm getting sober (58 days!!), and Zepbound has helped tremendously with the cravings. While Semaglutide also is known to have these effects, it's kind of scary to switch a drug when the stakes are this high (sobriety is literally life or death for me).

I think it would be nice to have a master list that people can reference. (Also I’m trying to find an online resource to ship to me from the US) my doctor prescribed it but my insurance refused. 

Thank you!! Hope this list helps someone since so many people come to this community trying to find out the best resources and I have heard the Canadian pharmacies aren’t sending to the US any longer? I have seen the following online pharmacies… has anyone had experiences with these ?

1lvqto6,No-Point-8580,Seasoned Semaglutide users…advice needed,"In August 2024 I started semaglutide injections. I started with the 0.25mg dose. I immediately had hunger suppression and started shedding pounds because I simply wasn’t eating much. By December 2024 I had lost 40 pounds. My fatty liver had gone away, A1C went down and periods got more regular. Then in January my dad died and I skipped filling my prescription because of everything going on. February I found out I had a T-rads 4 thyroid nodule. So, I stopped the injections and gained about 30 of the 40 lost pounds back. I talked to a doctor and decided to monitor the nodule because it is small and was cleared to continue my weight loss injections because my hypertension and other problems are more of a threat to my health than the thyroid nodule (found incidentally, no symptoms, bloodwork normal) for now. So I started back on the small dose last month. I’m now on 0.5mg and when I tell you I feel nothing, I mean NOTHING like I did the first time. I’m still hungry, still want to binge, no side effects, no weight loss. Nothing. Why would it work so well the first time but after 6 months off it, it doesn’t work anymore? It’s almost like they’re putting water in the vial instead of the medicine. I’m at a loss and the scale won’t budge. My dad dropped dead of a heart attack because he couldn’t get control of his weight. I’m 29 and headed down the dead at 56 path if I can’t get my weight below 200. I’m 5’10” 255 pounds. I was recently discovered to have a major hormone imbalance (low progesterone, low estrogen, low cortisol, high testosterone) that I am about to start bioidentical hormone replacement therapy for.

1lvken7,Nova_Sage_,Semaglutide for endometriosis,"Let me start by saying I’m a nurse for ten years (ER & ICU). My weight easily fluctuates, where I’ve been able to lose and gain relatively quickly. I am 5’4 at 174. Admittedly, I carry my weight well, to where even my PCP wasn’t surprised at my BMI and not concerned. I do, however, have endometriosis not necessarily confirmed with surgery (which PSA: is the only way to truly diagnose it) but I have a good rapport with my OB and symptoms plus family history (two of my sister required surgery and had stage 3&4), we felt comfortable calling a spade a spade. 

I’ve been hesitant to have the surgery just because it’s only a temporary fix and the longer you can put off surgery the more you can space out subsequent surgeries and decrease risk of adhesions. But since having my daughter (she’s 3) and stopping breast feeding (20months), my symptoms were awful. I have high pain tolerance (I passed a kidney stone at work then kept working) but the hip and pelvic pain was God awful and not just during my period. In addition to that, I felt constantly inflamed. My hands and feet were constantly swelling with no discernible reason. Labs were perfect other than low vit D (hello, inflammation/IBS). It was becoming more and more clear this was endometriosis which is an inflammatory disease.

Ozempic gets a bad rep, but I think a huge part of it is patients starting on too high of a dose and then moving up too quick. I ended up down the Ozempic rabbit hole when I read a case study in early stages using low dose (micro dose) semaglutide to treat endometriosis. Most of the current studies are in the early stages, but the anecdotal findings from patients and physicians alike has been really compelling. This led me down other rabbit holes of the true breakthrough that this drug is treating everything from chronic diseases to heroine addiction. As a nerd, this was an exciting. 

One thing I knew to be irrefutable is the fact that it is already known weight loss will decrease symptoms of endo (as well as PCOS) as fat cells produce estrogen (more fat cells = more estrogen). I’m on hormonal therapy for endo (progestin) which was taking the edge off but not remotely providing relief. So finally I said fuck it, ordered compounded semaglutide. My plan was only to microdose at 0.125mg indefinitely or until there are no more benefits. I’m almost finished with my second week and so far it’s been eye opening.

For starters, everything you’ve read about eating too much (or how much you ate before the shot) making you feel sick is true. Even at such a low dose, I’d experience nausea and stomach cramps if I ate large portions. When I eat smaller portions, not so bad. My GERD is slightly worse, but it was awful before so I hardly blame the shot for that. Since I’m not taking it for weight loss per se, I haven’t been tracking my weight but I’m nearly certain I’ve lost a good amount. My scrubs waist band was feeling snuck before and is now comfortable and loose now. I’m eating normal sized portions of food which is telling because I didn’t realize how much larger my portions were until this. I still have cravings every now and then, but nothing intense. I still experience hunger, etc I just require less food to feel satiated. 

Wildly enough, I’ve found myself craving fresher foods, eating more fruits and vegetables than I did before. Sometimes I’d notice I wasn’t feeling great and then I’d eat an apple and then nausea gone. Which was just so fascinating to me because I’ve never just been like “I could eat an apple or banana right now”. Like ever. As far as GI symptoms, I’ve had IBS all my life and that’s about the same. I treat the reflux with Pepcid (antacid) and Omeprazole (proton pump inhibitor) for longer relief and healing of my esophagus. Nausea was not new for me either, as I get this around my cycle with endometriosis but now I can get relief by eating a healthy snack. Again, this is just so fascinating to me. 

As far as my endometriosis, my pelvic pain has significantly decreased. The swelling in my hands and feet are gone. I feel less fatigue and moody. I still have the hip pain, but it’s more tolerable. For being only one and half weeks in, I found this pretty substantial but will  be curious to see how my next cycle goes. I started the injection right after my cycle to give my body time to adjust before the dreaded period. 

But to overview, microdosing seems effective for endo as well as weight loss. I’m eating better than before out of genuine almost as if the medicine makes me want healthier foods. Greasy unhealthy foods definitely don’t sit well with my stomach. Reflux is worse but it was already bad, so treating with meds and small snacks (GERD is worse on an empty stomach). Weight loss has been notable, but more likely due to retained fluid for it be this drastic so early, which is still an added bonus. Decreased hand and feet swelling has been a huge plus (I didn’t realize how much that was bothering me). IBS is the same—this medicine has not wrecked my stomach. If anyone is on the fence, I think it’s worth a try. Buying it compounded is definitely the cheapest, but I understand why most people wouldn’t feel comfortable doing that. 

As far as medicines, I’m taking Pepcid/famotidine 20mg twice a day, omeprazole 20mg daily, post-natal vitamins (left over from postpartum) and vit D 50,000u once a week (I take it with the shot bc it’s easier). I’m still on my prescription Adderall and Zoloft and no problems there. Will continue progestin (progesterone only BC for endo) and will update as my cycle progresses for anyone with endo.

Admittedly, I carry my weight well, to where even my PCP wasn’t surprised at my BMI and not concerned. I do, however, have endometriosis not necessarily confirmed with surgery (which PSA: is the only way to truly diagnose it) but I have a good rapport with my OB and symptoms plus family history (two of my sister required surgery and had stage 3&4), we felt comfortable calling a spade a spade. 

I’ve been hesitant to have the surgery just because it’s only a temporary fix and the longer you can put off surgery the more you can space out subsequent surgeries and decrease risk of adhesions. But since having my daughter (she’s 3) and stopping breast feeding (20months), my symptoms were awful. I have high pain tolerance (I passed a kidney stone at work then kept working) but the hip and pelvic pain was God awful and not just during my period. In addition to that, I felt constantly inflamed. My hands and feet were constantly swelling with no discernible reason. Labs were perfect other than low vit D (hello, inflammation/IBS). It was becoming more and more clear this was endometriosis which is an inflammatory disease.

Ozempic gets a bad rep, but I think a huge part of it is patients starting on too high of a dose and then moving up too quick. I ended up down the Ozempic rabbit hole when I read a case study in early stages using low dose (micro dose) semaglutide to treat endometriosis. Most of the current studies are in the early stages, but the anecdotal findings from patients and physicians alike has been really compelling. This led me down other rabbit holes of the true breakthrough that this drug is treating everything from chronic diseases to heroine addiction. As a nerd, this was an exciting. 

One thing I knew to be irrefutable is the fact that it is already known weight loss will decrease symptoms of endo (as well as PCOS) as fat cells produce estrogen (more fat cells = more estrogen). I’m on hormonal therapy for endo (progestin) which was taking the edge off but not remotely providing relief. So finally I said fuck it, ordered compounded semaglutide. My plan was only to microdose at 0.125mg indefinitely or until there are no more benefits. I’m almost finished with my second week and so far it’s been eye opening.

For starters, everything you’ve read about eating too much (or how much you ate before the shot) making you feel sick is true. Even at such a low dose, I’d experience nausea and stomach cramps if I ate large portions. When I eat smaller portions, not so bad. My GERD is slightly worse, but it was awful before so I hardly blame the shot for that. Since I’m not taking it for weight loss per se, I haven’t been tracking my weight but I’m nearly certain I’ve lost a good amount. My scrubs waist band was feeling snuck before and is now comfortable and loose now. I’m eating normal sized portions of food which is telling because I didn’t realize how much larger my portions were until this. I still have cravings every now and then, but nothing intense. I still experience hunger, etc I just require less food to feel satiated. 

Wildly enough, I’ve found myself craving fresher foods, eating more fruits and vegetables than I did before. Sometimes I’d notice I wasn’t feeling great and then I’d eat an apple and then nausea gone. Which was just so fascinating to me because I’ve never just been like “I could eat an apple or banana right now”. Like ever. As far as GI symptoms, I’ve had IBS all my life and that’s about the same. I treat the reflux with Pepcid (antacid) and Omeprazole (proton pump inhibitor) for longer relief and healing of my esophagus. Nausea was not new for me either, as I get this around my cycle with endometriosis but now I can get relief by eating a healthy snack. Again, this is just so fascinating to me. 

As far as my endometriosis, my pelvic pain has significantly decreased. The swelling in my hands and feet are gone. I feel less fatigue and moody. I still have the hip pain, but it’s more tolerable. For being only one and half weeks in, I found this pretty substantial but will  be curious to see how my next cycle goes. I started the injection right after my cycle to give my body time to adjust before the dreaded period. 

But to overview, microdosing seems effective for endo as well as weight loss. I’m eating better than before out of genuine almost as if the medicine makes me want healthier foods. Greasy unhealthy foods definitely don’t sit well with my stomach. Reflux is worse but it was already bad, so treating with meds and small snacks (GERD is worse on an empty stomach). Weight loss has been notable, but more likely due to retained fluid for it be this drastic so early, which is still an added bonus. Decreased hand and feet swelling has been a huge plus (I didn’t realize how much that was bothering me). IBS is the same—this medicine has not wrecked my stomach. If anyone is on the fence, I think it’s worth a try. Buying it compounded is definitely the cheapest, but I understand why most people wouldn’t feel comfortable doing that. 

As far as medicines, I’m taking Pepcid/famotidine 20mg twice a day, omeprazole 20mg daily, post-natal vitamins (left over from postpartum) and vit D 50,000u once a week (I take it with the shot bc it’s easier). I’m still on my prescription Adderall and Zoloft and no problems there. Will continue progestin (progesterone only BC for endo) and will update as my cycle progresses for anyone with endo.

1m0k483,Sad_Crazy_566,Stay on Semaglutide or switch to Tirzepitide,"Hi - just looking for some opinions on my situation. I started Semaglutide back in February and have only lost about 6-7 pounds since then. I'm not on the max dose yet but I will be soon. I'm feeling a little disappointed and impatient and thinking about switching to Tirzepitide.

1kxa3ej,Just_Wolverine_5622,Thinking About Switching to Tirzepatide — Anyone Else Make the Jump from Semaglutide?,"Hey everyone,

I’ve been on semaglutide for a little over 4 months now (currently at 1.7mg) and have lost around 40 lbs total. Appetite suppression has been solid, cravings are way more manageable, and I’ve built a better routine overall. So, in many ways, it’s working.

But lately, I feel like I’ve plateaued a bit — weight loss has slowed down, and side effects (especially fatigue and constipation) have been creeping back in. I’ve been hearing more and more about tirzepatide and how some people see even better results with fewer side effects.

**For anyone who switched from semaglutide to tirzepatide:**

* What made you decide to switch?
* How was the transition?
* Did you notice a big difference in hunger control, side effects, or energy?
* Anything you wish you knew before switching?

Appreciate any insight — just trying to figure out if it’s worth bringing up to my doctor or if I should stick it out a little longer.

Everyone is different, of course, but a low dose of GLP-1 meds (first semaglutide, then retatrutide) helped me break the cycle of binging and purging after 20+ years of throwing up at least once a day.

Medication is not a replacement for therapy or working through your issues -- I am doing that too! But for me it helped calm the food noise and cravings and obsessive thinking, and helps regulate my blood sugar. It bought me the space to make better choices and set better habits.

1jt3bmc,FangShway,I wasnt getting desired results until I started pairing semaglutide with Naltrexone.,"I had been taking 2mg of semaglutide per week and was having very inconsistent results. Most of the time it has a very minor effects that would wear off on day 3-4. Some weeks it would work great and sometimes it felt like I didn't take it at all. 

I tried spreading my dose out but dipping down from 2mg to 1mg twice a week when I sometimes barely felt the effects of 2mg wasn't much of a solution either.

Thankfully I have little to no side effects other than the burps occasionally but I was getting very little *intended* effects as well. I still very much had ""food noise"" all of the time and craved sweets more than I ever had before taking a GLP-1.

I had taken it for 12 months, I lost 40lbs in the first 3 months and 5-10 more over the remaining 9 months. (290 - ~245). I wasnt putting in any extra effort to lose weight at the time. I didn't try any special diet and I wasnt getting regular excersize. I just new all my portions were much smaller.

I was off it for 5 months and was able to maintain my weight between 245 and 250 as I started excersizing regularly playing pickleball. While I was off of it, I had been prescribed Naltrexone which had a very minor effect of curbing cravings. Not enough to really help lose weight but enough to help maintain it. 

I got back on semaglutide last month and taking it in concert with Naltrexone has been a night and day difference. I finally understand what it feels like to not have food noise or feel like I want to eat even if I'm not hungry.

I am confident that it is the interaction with Naltrexone as I had a mixup with my prescription and was not able to take it for a week, and during that time, the semaglutide started feeling weaker as it had previously. And once I got back on the Naltrexone the following week, the desired effects returned.

1l1i0ux,SpeakerAltruistic123,"I tell people Ozempic lets me eat all I want, it is is never too much","I have lost weight whilst on Ozempic. I'm happy to tell people the secret, while adding the phrase in the title. Usually, I see a little envy in their microexpressions. I think it is because people flash back to their childhood, when they could eat all they wanted without much weight gain. (in most cases)

1k76e2y,letsgoyahoowoops,PSA: If you're on Ozempic or Mounjaro and weed feels flat or “off”… it’s not in your head.,"So I’ve been smoking regularly for years, mainly for emotional regulation, introspection, and that feeling of being really present or in awe. A few months into being on Ozempic (semaglutide) and later Mounjaro (tirzepatide), I noticed something really strange:

Weed still got me “high,” but it was… muted. No body buzz. No emotional waves. No music chills. Just kind of detached and numb, like my brain was watching the high from 10 feet away.

At first, I thought it was tolerance. Switched strains. Tried higher doses. Took t-breaks. Nothing helped.

Then I started digging into the science and what I found honestly made me angry:

GLP-1 drugs like Ozempic and Mounjaro can desensitize serotonin 5-HT2A receptors (the same ones psychedelics activate), which are critical for the emotional, awe-filled, “deep” part of the cannabis experience.

Even worse? Nobody talks about this. Not doctors. Not the drug companies. There are no warnings, no studies on cannabis interaction, and zero mention of how it can totally change your relationship with weed.

If you’re on one of these meds and weed doesn’t feel right anymore, you’re not crazy, this is a real neurochemical shift. And if you’re someone who uses weed for more than just a buzz (like managing mood or trauma), this can feel like a big loss.

Just wanted to put this out there for anyone else feeling gaslit or confused by the change. You’re not alone, and we need more people talking about it.

UPDATE (April 29, 2025):
After more digging (and personal testing), I’ve realized Tirzepatide (Mounjaro) is likely a much bigger culprit than Ozempic when it comes to muting the effects of weed.

Tirzepatide doesn’t just hit GLP-1 receptors,  it also targets GIP receptors, which play a role in dopamine and reward signaling. Activating GIP receptors seems to further blunt the emotional and sensory impact of THC downstream in the brain, especially in key areas like the nucleus accumbens.

In plain English:
If you're on Mounjaro, weed can feel even flatter and more detached than it would on Ozempic alone, because it's dampening the brain circuits that THC normally lights up.

Still frustrated there’s no warning about this anywhere.

1ogz56g,InstanceSure4186,"2 Years on Ozempic — Strict, Disciplined, and Still Stuck at the Same Weight. Scared to Stop Because the Food Noise Comes Back.","Hey everyone,

I’ve been on Ozempic for almost 2 years, now on Wegovy 2.4 mg, and I’m honestly at a loss. I’ve been trying to lose weight for 3 years straight and despite doing everything right, the scale hasn’t really moved.

I also take Metformin 500 mg, blood pressure meds, cholesterol meds, and Vyvanse 10 mg.

About 3 weeks ago I started doing OMAD (One Meal A Day) and have stuck to it almost perfectly (just one 16:8 day). Before OMAD, I wasn’t a big eater either — I usually skipped breakfast and only ate lunch and dinner. I don’t drink any calorie beverages either, other than alcohol once a week.

Here’s what I’ve been doing consistently:
	•	High-protein, low-carb meals
	•	Calorie intake under 1,800/day
	•	Lifting 2–3x a week
	•	Walking/golf daily
	•	2–3L of water + electrolytes
	•	7+ hours of sleep with CPAP (sleep apnea managed)

Despite all that — I started at 273 lbs, dropped to 267 lbs the first week of OMAD, and now I’m right back at 273 lbs again.
It’s like my body just refuses to let go of weight no matter how much I dial in my diet or exercise.

The most frustrating part?
I actually feel healthier — my resting heart rate is down, energy is better, and I don’t feel sluggish anymore. But seeing zero movement on the scale after years of trying is disheartening.

And honestly, I’m terrified to stop Ozempic. The food noise — that constant mental chatter around food — was brutal before I started. It’s the one thing Ozempic completely silenced, and I’m scared it would all come back if I stopped.

Has anyone else hit this kind of long-term plateau where everything looks perfect on paper but your body just won’t budge?
What finally worked for you — if anything?
Did anyone switch medications or tweak something that finally moved the needle?

⸻

TL;DR:
2 years on Ozempic/Wegovy + Metformin, clean diet, fasting, workouts, no calorie drinks, and still the same weight. Feel better but can’t lose a pound. Scared to stop Ozempic because the food noise gets loud again.

2 years on Ozempic/Wegovy + Metformin, clean diet, fasting, workouts, no calorie drinks, and still the same weight. Feel better but can’t lose a pound. Scared to stop Ozempic because the food noise gets loud again.

1o2ol2t,letsgoyahoowoops,I keep losing weight on Ozempic plus Buspirone and I am not sure what is going on,"Hey everyone. I wanted to share what has been happening to me because I am a little confused and kind of amazed at the same time.

So I have been on Ozempic for about four months now for insulin resistance and weight management. The results have been pretty typical at first like slow and steady weight loss, less hunger, the usual nausea during the first few weeks. Everything felt pretty normal.

Then my doctor added Buspirone about six weeks ago for anxiety. It has helped a lot with the mental side of things, but ever since starting it, my appetite has basically disappeared. Like, completely gone some days.

I know Ozempic already makes you feel full faster, but this feels next level. I will make a meal, take a few bites, and I am done. Even the smell of food sometimes feels like enough. It is kind of wild.

I have lost around nine pounds since adding Buspirone, which is way faster than before. I have not been trying to eat less, but it just happens naturally because I do not want food. I am not nauseous, just completely uninterested in eating.

I am wondering if anyone else here has had this combo and noticed the same thing. Is it possible the Buspirone is making the Ozempic effects stronger? Or is this just random timing and my body finally responding more to the Ozempic?

Either way I am keeping an eye on it because I do not want to lose too much too fast. My doctor said to track calories and make sure I am getting enough protein and hydration.

Would love to hear if anyone else is on both and what your experience has been like.

1lwkbq9,Maleficent_Sea3061,Has anyone experienced suicidal thoughts or severe depression after taking Semaglutide (Ozempic/Wegovy)?,"Important note: It was prescribed for diabetes, their weight was healthy when they started taking it.

Edit: I understand the medication is beneficial to people and fully support anyone taking it when it is helping them.

My friend died by suicide within months after starting Semaglutide (Rybelsus) for diabetes – has anyone experienced mental health side effects?

It seems to be a 'growing' area of interest with no clear answers. The drug acts on brain receptors, affects the reward system (dopamine) and changes lifestyle habits so I think there's a link.

People trust what is being prescribed to them for diabetes. They had a history of depression, but no suicidal ideation, two kids and a wife - my friend was in his 60s - obviously rapidly lost weight.

The research shows it has an impact on dopamine, there are GLP-1 receptors in the brain, it obviously impacts mood. However, there are not many clinical trials or real-world data around the medication and suicidal ideation. This is for a few reasons:

\- You can't really ethically test on people with this history, especially if the drug being prescribed is for something other than mental health

Important note: It was prescribed for diabetes, their weight was healthy when they started taking it.

Edit: I understand the medication is beneficial to people and fully support anyone taking it when it is helping them.

My friend died by suicide within months after starting Semaglutide (Rybelsus) for diabetes – has anyone experienced mental health side effects?

It seems to be a 'growing' area of interest with no clear answers. The drug acts on brain receptors, affects the reward system (dopamine) and changes lifestyle habits so I think there's a link.

People trust what is being prescribed to them for diabetes. They had a history of depression, but no suicidal ideation, two kids and a wife - my friend was in his 60s - obviously rapidly lost weight.

The research shows it has an impact on dopamine, there are GLP-1 receptors in the brain, it obviously impacts mood. However, there are not many clinical trials or real-world data around the medication and suicidal ideation. This is for a few reasons:

\- You can't really ethically test on people with this history, especially if the drug being prescribed is for something other than mental health

\- Real-world data would rely on family or friends making the link between GLP-1 and problematic mood / ideation

\- Suicide is complex

My doctor told me that if I don’t lose 10% of my body weight (around 17.5 lbs / 8 kg) within three months, I should stop taking it. Is that really how it works? Should I be worried? I know she’s the MD here, but I can’t help feeling anxious about my pace.

Has anyone here stayed under the 10% threshold early on but still continued and saw results later?

For context — Ozempic is kind of my last hail mary. I’ve been struggling with weight for years because of PCOS, and I really don’t want to give up on semaglutide if there’s still hope.

TL;DR: 2 months on Ozempic, down 6.5 lbs (3 kg). Doctor says I need 10% (~17.5 lbs / 8 kg) loss in 3 months or stop. Worried about slow pace, have PCOS, hoping to continue. Anyone else start slow but still see results later?

1nnjo0u,Feisty_Profession612,My body hates 1mg Ozempic (but 0.5 did nothing),"I’ve been on Ozempic for a bit now and I can’t really figure out if what I’m going through is normal. On 0.5 mg literally nothing happened. No side effects, no appetite changes, just felt like I was wasting time.

Then I went up to 1 mg. First shot: fine, just some gross sulfur burps. Second shot: same. Third shot: it started hitting harder, cramps, food just sitting in my stomach for hours. Fourth shot: complete nightmare. Within 24 hours I had waves of extreme stomach cramps and ended up throwing up more then ever before. I’m not exaggerating when I say the smell literally reeked of death.

Since then it’s been all over the place. Some days I can manage with light stuff like rice cakes, soup, applesauce. The next day I eat something more normal and my stomach turns on me again and I’m either nauseous or running to the bathroom. No pattern I can trust.

What’s messing with me the most is the hunger cycle. First 4 days after the shot I don’t care about food at all. Day 5 I start feeling a bit more hungry. By day 6 and 7 it’s like the urge is completely back, like the shot never happened. Then I inject again and repeat the whole thing.

I was on Saxenda for over a year and never had this, so it feels strange that Ozempic is hitting me this way. 0.5 mg feels useless, 1 mg feels too much, and I’m stuck between. I’ve even thought about doing 1 mg every 10 days instead of weekly to see if that helps.

Right now I’m eating small and light, drinking ORS when I feel drained, but it’s frustrating not knowing if this is just an adjustment phase or if this is how it’s going to be for me.

Has anyone else had this? Like nothing at 0.5, total chaos at 1 mg, and appetite suppression that only lasts for half the week? Did it ever settle down or did you have to change dosing?

1fwjwxx,Trying-12,18 months on Ozempic. 115lbs down,"115lbs down
I’ve been on Ozempic now for 18 months, starting at 355lbs and as of today I’m currently 239.8lbs, and I nearly cried seeing the scale under 240. I’ve been dealing with some other issues as of late, both mentally and physically, however I was able to take a short leave from work to get all that in order. In the last few months I’ve also gotten a personal trainer and I’m excited seeing my body getting stronger. I haven’t been this weight in over 10 years. 

I eventually want to get to 90kg , so just at about  198lbs. I’m not sure what I’ll want at that point. I’m a tall woman (5’11”) and have a more muscular frame so I think I’d be content at about 175lbs for maintenance. But it's wild, l've lost over 10 inches from my hips (which was really mainly belly) and about 10 inches from my waist. It may be more though as I forgot to measure at my heaviest and only measured when I was already down 25lbs.

I had a bit of a stall from Oct 2023 to April 2024 at about 270 but I’ve been focusing on moving more. Out of the 115lbs lost, 50 were in the last year but 21 were in the last 3 months. Those 3 months include 2 months of weight training. I included those stats.

1kxt77h,wildinthemembrane,Is it safe to take Ozempic while actively bulimic?,"I’ve been bulimic for 15 years. Usually I purge once a day, but sometimes it’s more like 3 or more times. Occasionally I can go 3 or 4 days without purging, but that’s rare. Right now, it’s around 2 to 3 times a week.

My doctor knows about my history and I remind him every time we talk. He still decided to put me on Ozempic and I’m currently taking 0.25 mg. (I’m medically obese on the BMI chart). He mentioned that it won’t help with dopamine-driven eating like emotional binges, which I understand. I tried to tell him that Vyvanse was the only thing that ever worked for me. While I was on Vyvanse for 30 days, I didn’t binge or purge once and I had zero urges. It was the only time I’ve felt actual control.

I have a formal ADHD diagnosis from a psychiatrist I’ve seen three times. Despite this, my current doctor keeps saying “I’m not buying it” and refuses to prescribe Vyvanse. I’m frustrated, but I’m trying to work with what I’ve got.

So here’s my question. Is it actually safe to continue taking Ozempic while I’m still purging a few times a week? I’ve searched for info but most of it is vague or doesn’t address active bulimia.

1nbo2fl,Queasy_Explorer_9361,"Ozempic Hunger rebound, maintanance, Set point, facial changes","Hey everyone,

I’ve been using Ozempic mainly as part of my bodybuilding approach during a diet phase. I lost about 15 kg (around 33 lbs), got down to a normal weight, and managed to preserve my muscle mass. The side effects were limited to occasional mild constipation, so overall I was really, really satisfied.

Now I’m wondering: for those of you who have used Ozempic and then stopped it, did you experience a strong return of hunger and something like a yo-yo effect? Or did you feel more like you had established a new setpoint and were able to maintain your weight?

Another thing I’d like to ask about: I’ve noticed some facial changes – my face looks a bit sunken, I have dark circles under my eyes, and my eyes appear slightly hollow. Has anyone else experienced this, and did it improve or go away over time?

What makes it really annoying to try and find definitive information about this is that there just \*isn't\* much else to compare GLP1s to, in order to figure out if there's any other statistically significant effect of using GLP1s to lose weight and whether the skin acts differently.

For now, outside of anecdata (albeit from experts/plastic surgeons), the effects of this seems to just be rapid weight loss (like what would happen if you lost weight any other way).

1i3o2e9,FormerlyObeseJ,33 Must-Know Tips for Ozempic/Wegovy Beginners,"Here are the top tips distilled from hundreds of posts into one straightforward list.

1. Take ""before"" pictures – you'll regret not having them later.
2. Record all your body measurements before starting – the tape measure often shows progress when the scale doesn't.
3. Don't expect overnight results, some people don't see changes until month 3.
4. Choose your injection day wisely – ideally before your days off.
5. Stay at each dose for a minimum of 4 weeks to minimize side effects.
6. Your ideal dose is the lowest one that works for you - higher doses don't necessarily mean better results.
7. Rotate where you inject: your tummy, thighs, upper arms.
8. Don't skip meals, even when not hungry to maintain stable blood sugar.
9. Prioritize protein in every meal.
10. Focus on getting enough fiber daily, target 25-35g each day.
11. Plan your meals in advance.
12. Track your calories consistently using a reliable app.
13. Drink more water than you think you need – dehydration worsens side effects.
14. Jazz up your water with flavoring or find a bottle you love – whatever helps you drink more.
15. Avoid high-fat and fried foods – they can trigger nausea.
16. Stay away from carbonated beverages.
17. Avoid acidic foods and drinks that might trigger reflux.
18. Wait 3 hours after eating before lying down.
19. Rate your fullness after meals - it feels different now.
20. Start a simple walking routine – even a few minutes daily helps.
21. Track your steps and gradually increase them.
22. Keep protein shakes handy for low-appetite days.
23. Have ginger chews available for nausea.
24. Keep Gas-X on hand for digestive discomfort.
25. Keep both Miralax and Imodium on hand for potential bowel issues.
26. Monitor your bowel movements, anything beyond 3 days without one requires action.
27. Add hair vitamins or collagen protein powder if you notice thinning hair.
28. Choose simple, whole foods over complex, heavily sauced meals.
29. Create a daily movement ritual by parking in the farthest spot and taking stairs whenever possible.
30. Build a support system – be selective about who you share your journey with.
31. Keep realistic expectations - sustainable loss is better than quick fixes.
32. Don't compare your experience to others - everyone's body responds differently.
33. Remember: Ozempic is a tool to help you make better choices, not a miracle solution.

1ab76ii,sandsaltwaterwaves,Ozempic not working,"I started ozempic around August 2021 at 210. As of December 2023 I was around 189, but currently sitting at 194 at a 2mg dose. I see so many stories where people effortlessly are losing more weight in a shorter period of time.

1o100lx,Relevant-Position-57,Ozempic vs Wegovy,"I was on a med last year and lost 30lbs but it was out of pocket. I finally got insurance to cover Zepbound which I thought would be great and faster results. After 5 shots I ended up with what felt like an allergic reaction with severe effects - my first ever panic attack, heart palpitations, high blood pressure and was dizzy for a month straight - I couldn’t drive. I had 4 ER visits and all tests came back “fine.” They said it was anxiety which I’ve never experienced prior. I didn’t correlate everything to Zepbound because I was fine all last year on the other . I took about 2-3 months off after that and hoped to try Ozempic vs Wegovy as I thought Ozempic might be closer to what I took last year and from what I’ve read, it affects heart rate the least out of all the meds. I have has ZERO side effects, thank goodness! BUT I haven’t lost ANY weight! I’m due for my 12th shot this week and last week was my first dose of 1mg. I made sure to titer up slowly to avoid any negative side effects given Zepbound disrupted my life so severely and that dose starts so much higher at 2.5mg right away. So I guess I explain all of this to say, since I haven’t lost anything on ozempic(but I read 1-2mg is the therapeutic dose) ———so is there any chance Wegovy would help me if I switched or do you think I still wouldn’t see any weight loss since it’s so similar to ozempic?

1kuh9iz,wildinthemembrane,Day 4 on Ozempic and the binging is out of control… help?,"I’m on my 4th day of 0.25mg Ozempic and I’m honestly freaking out. I haven’t craved sugar in over six months. I got through Easter, birthdays, dinners out, all of it without any issues. I’ve been eating really healthy and sticking to my goals for a long time.

Now, since starting Ozempic, the binging is out of control. Last night I ate a huge bag of Skittles in 10 minutes. I even binged on a whole bag of sugar-free cough drops, which was a terrible idea. I know people will say “just don’t buy it,” and that makes sense in theory, but the cravings feel completely overwhelming. It honestly feels similar to being on an edible and getting the munchies. The hunger and urge to eat won’t stop.

I’m eating a minimum of 100 grams of protein a day. My meals usually include eggs, cottage cheese, chicken or steak, vegetables, and oatmeal. I also take hair gummies, magnesium bisglycinate, zinc, a multivitamin, vitamin B12, and fiber gummies every single day. I add collagen powder to my coffee once a day too. I feel like I’m doing everything right.

Today alone I’m already 600 calories over my daily limit of 1300, which I was able to stick to easily before Ozempic. I feel starving and totally out of control. Is this normal at the beginning? Does it eventually settle down? I would really appreciate any advice or personal experiences. I was prescribed ozempic due to being overweight but also as a means to treat my BED and bulimia.

The low dose is working for food noise (but not weight loss)","Hi all, first time posting on this forum. I started Ozempic three weeks ago on a 0.25 dose and got some pretty instant results in terms of my physiology. Almost as soon as my first dose, I noticed some issues I have been struggling with decreasing. Previously, If I didn't eat on time or enough I got terrible stomach cramps. If I skipped a meal I got strong headaches. If I ate enough to be satisfied, I'd be extremely drowsy after the meal, particularly lunch time. All of this seems to have disappeared overnight along with the 'food noise' many posts mention on here. 

I have had some nausea, and that combined with the fact that it seems to be 'working', makes me wonder if I shouldn't stick where I am on 0.25 rather than moving up to 0.5 the week after next.

On the other hand, I had an instant appetite decrease and energy uptick. I have been monitoring CiCo and have been fairly consistently in a deficit of around 4-500 kCal per day. The scale has not moved an iota, which I am a bit surprised about considering my high levels of activity (between 10-15,000 steps per day) and Cal deficit.

1dp9ba8,Feisty_Fee_3841,First day using Wegovy,I have been working out since 2021. In total I have lost over 50 lbs which I'm very proud of. I am currently sitting in the 250s. I still work with a dietician and strength train 5 days a week and hit a wall in weight loss for a little over a year now. I haven't gained any weight but I haven't lost any either. My dietician had me reverse diet and then go back into a deficit and did everything including consulting other collegues to get input on why I may have it a plateau so badly. After my PCP and dietician having multiple conversations they gave me my options to see if maybe I just need some outside help. So today I started Wegovy. I'm not going to lie and say I'm not nervous about drug intervention but it's either this or surgery. The weight needs to come off due to other health issues.

I don’t want to share personal details here because im paranoid someone I know will find this. I recently gained 30 lbs after I started dating my boyfriend. He eats a lot, so I ate a lot. It slowly crept up on me and before I knew it my doctor told me I was overweight. 
I wasn’t super overweight, but enough where my insurance approved my wegovy prescription. Im now on .5 mg dose and I love it. Not much bad side effects. It’s made me eat barely anything now.

12dmzew,Agreeablemartini,Starting wegovy! Follow along for updates.,"I picked up my first 4 shots (one weekly) of 0.25 mg wegovy today! I’m going to administer the first one on Monday. I’m a 29 year old 5’ 5” woman and my starting weight fluctuates between 240-250lbs. It’s been really difficult shedding weight so I’m trying this now in hopes for a little extra push in addition to working out three times a week with a relatively healthy diet which I’ve been doing for a few years. 
I’ll update as I can!

Mon April 10 
9:00AM- I just did my first shot and it was easy breezy! Directions are super straight forward and the pen is easy to use. The needle is so tiny I didn’t even feel it going into my leg. The pen will click when you put it in and then click again about 2 Mississippi second later to say that it’s done. The needle automatically retracts and you can put the cap back on so the chance of an accidental stick is very low. I will check back later today if I feel any side affects. 
Scale this morning said 241 lbs

Fri April 14
The side effects haven’t been awful, but I have had a tummy ache all week and have been super tired. Not nauseous the way the side effects say, but more of a bloated burn-y sensation. Lots of burping? I’ve also been super tired, but that may be from another medication since it doesn’t specifically say tiredness as a side effect. My appetite has been significantly reduced but I can’t tell if that’s a good thing or not because it’s been difficult to eat much of anything and may also account for the tiredness. Scale this morning was 233 lbs.

Monday April 17 - just did the second dose this morning. Definitely easier the second time around! The nausea eased up over the week, but I’m nervous it will start over again today. We shall see. Scale says 241 lbs this morning.

Saturday April 22 - the nausea that I was feeling most of last week was MUCH less this week. I did experience some heart racing after drinking a cup of coffee a couple days ago, but it difficult to say if that’s because of the wegovy or a recently increased dose of vyvanse. Scale this morning was 237 lbs.

Thursday April 27 - unsure if it’s wegovy related, but I have had horrible diarrhea this week. Very bad Monday and last night/today. It does say that it is a side effect so I thought it would be best to document it. This is after taking the 3rd shot of the month. Scale today is 237.

Thursday May 18 - i still get random bouts of diarrhea here and there and it kinda sucks. I also noticed a lot of burping lately and saw that it was a side effect of Wegovy. Appetite is very low— almost too low. There is zero snacking between meals and most meals I can only get half way through. Might be a good sign, but my energy is super low. Scale is still at 233– wish I was seeing a little more movement after a month and a half. I’m still on the same first dose for some reason.

qanxvt,timmyrae,Wegovy - First Week,"I just began taking Wegovy last week and thought others might find my experience interesting/helpful.  

(By the way, this is my first post on Reddit...I joined just to hear about other people's Wegovy experiences and thought I would add mine too in case it's helpful.  Sorry this post is a bit long winded.)

A few statistics--I am a 40 year old cis-male, I currently weight 378 pounds and I am 6'0"".  In addition, I think it is important to know that I am an attorney at a large firm and the pressure and anxiety is, at times, nearly overwhelming, particularly during the last 9 months.  During that time I gained close to 80 pounds from binge eating.  I rarely snack between meals or after dinner, but I will eat extremely large portions and will often order meals for 2 and eat both in one sitting.  I have not cooked a meal at home since February 2021 and clearly do not order the healthiest of delivery options.

I met with an endocrinologist in NYCto discuss weight management/loss options.  If anyone in the NYC area is looking for a clinic like this, I would recommend this highly.  Happy to share more info.

After discussing my eating habits, lifestyle, motivations, etc., we discussed medication options.  Essentially there were 3 choices I was given--one typically given to treat diabetes (apologies as I do not remember the name), Topomax and Wegovy.  Frankly, I came to the clinic hoping I would be prescribed Wegovy, but did not ask before the doctor provided these options as I wanted to hear what she recommended without my influence.

As others have noted, getting the beginning level dose of Wegovy can be difficult.  Both because many pharmacies are unable to keep it in stock due to lagging production unable to keep pace with the extreme demand and because many insurance providers are not (yet) covering the $1300 drug.  Unfortunately, my insurance denied coverage.  The manufacturer has a coupon for $200 off, but even with that the first month cost around $1100.  I am lucky to be able to afford this for a few more months, but it may be a complete non-starter for many people.

I used Alto to deliver the medication and it came in a box with ice packs to keep it cool.  You store the box in the refrigerator until ready to use.  I was nervous about the injection itself, but my concern was misplaced.  It was extremely easy and needle is never visible and is extremely small--I truly barely felt it.  I chose to inject on a fatty part of my stomach.  You push the pin in until you hear a click and then you watch a yellow bar that moves down a clear window on the side of the pin.  As it injects the drug you will hear another click.  You do not remove the pin until the yellow bar reaches (almost) the bottom of the window and quits moving.  I watched a video on YouTube that was posted by the manufacturer too, which is helpful, and they advised to count slowly to 10 before from the first click removing.  Obviously, please read the directions that come with the drugs as I am definitely leaving out some details!

I have not yet experienced any negative side effects, but the doctor told me to plan on small portions to avoid nausea these first few days after which your lack of appetite should help you avoid the big portions altogether.  I have not had much of an appetite today, but candidly I am wondering if this is psychosomatic as I am not sure it could work that quickly.  Perhaps I am wrong!  Regardless, whether it's my mind playing tricks on me or the drug, I'll take it.  I had yogurt both for breakfast and for lunch and fish with vegetables for dinner (trust me, the fish wasn't that healthy, but I was able to stop at only a half portion).

I know that diet and exercise will always be a key part of any effective and lasting weight loss.  I have lost over 100 pounds twice before but have been unable to keep it off.  I am very hopeful that this will be an aid in acheiving lasting health.

My plan is to provide updates once a month as I start on the next dosage and if anything interesting/concerning/exciting happens in the meantime, I'll post that too.  Hope others find this helpful.

(Just want to make it extra clear that I am not a doctor, nor do I have any medical expertise whatsoever!  I really wanted to get an idea of the experiance others have had before starting and I did find a few.  Happy to answer questions about my experience--apologies in advance if it takes a bit for me to respond.)",10,4,2021-10-18T20:06:38,WeightLossAdvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/qanxvt/wegovy_first_week/,0.87,True,/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/qanxvt/wegovy_first_week/,2025-10-27T19:09:45.984117,"Wegovy - First Week I just began taking Wegovy last week and thought others might find my experience interesting/helpful.

Essentially there were 3 choices I was given--one typically given to treat diabetes (apologies as I do not remember the name), Topomax and Wegovy.  Frankly, I came to the clinic hoping I would be prescribed Wegovy, but did not ask before the doctor provided these options as I wanted to hear what she recommended without my influence.

As others have noted, getting the beginning level dose of Wegovy can be difficult.  Both because many pharmacies are unable to keep it in stock due to lagging production unable to keep pace with the extreme demand and because many insurance providers are not (yet) covering the $1300 drug.  Unfortunately, my insurance denied coverage.  The manufacturer has a coupon for $200 off, but even with that the first month cost around $1100.  I am lucky to be able to afford this for a few more months, but it may be a complete non-starter for many people.

I used Alto to deliver the medication and it came in a box with ice packs to keep it cool.  You store the box in the refrigerator until ready to use.  I was nervous about the injection itself, but my concern was misplaced.  It was extremely easy and needle is never visible and is extremely small--I truly barely felt it.  I chose to inject on a fatty part of my stomach.  You push the pin in until you hear a click and then you watch a yellow bar that moves down a clear window on the side of the pin.  As it injects the drug you will hear another click.  You do not remove the pin until the yellow bar reaches (almost) the bottom of the window and quits moving.  I watched a video on YouTube that was posted by the manufacturer too, which is helpful, and they advised to count slowly to 10 before from the first click removing.  Obviously, please read the directions that come with the drugs as I am definitely leaving out some details!

I have not yet experienced any negative side effects, but the doctor told me to plan on small portions to avoid nausea these first few days after which your lack of appetite should help you avoid the big portions altogether.  I have not had much of an appetite today, but candidly I am wondering if this is psychosomatic as I am not sure it could work that quickly.  Perhaps I am wrong!  Regardless, whether it's my mind playing tricks on me or the drug, I'll take it.  I had yogurt both for breakfast and for lunch and fish with vegetables for dinner (trust me, the fish wasn't that healthy, but I was able to stop at only a half portion).

I know that diet and exercise will always be a key part of any effective and lasting weight loss.  I have lost over 100 pounds twice before but have been unable to keep it off.  I am very hopeful that this will be an aid in acheiving lasting health.

My plan is to provide updates once a month as I start on the next dosage and if anything interesting/concerning/exciting happens in the meantime, I'll post that too.  Hope others find this helpful.

(Just want to make it extra clear that I am not a doctor, nor do I have any medical expertise whatsoever!  I really wanted to get an idea of the experiance others have had before starting and I did find a few.  Happy to answer questions about my experience--apologies in advance if it takes a bit for me to respond.)",wegovy first begin take wegovy last think might find experience interesting helpful way first

1gr5st5,chubbybuddyfat,"Actually sick of it. Under 1000 calories per day, taking prescribed aide, training twice a day, not losing weight ","Here's a fun one. I know it's not sustainable long term, but I wanted to kick-start 20kg off then taper to something more sustainable. Completely over it though. I wouldn't mind if I was losing weight, but literally nothing has come off in 4 weeks. 


Preamble: I used to be extremely fit and healthy. Competed at top levels of sport well into my late 20s and worked in physically demanding fields. Injury hit, got lazy, then fell into deep depression and put on a lot of weight. 
Hit peak 3 months ago of 132kg at 170cm. Am now mid 30s.


Got my head right, got back into a style of training like I was used to and enjoy. Went to doctor as well and was prescribed Wegovy. 8 weeks in now. This is where it gets frustrating. 


First month on 0.25mg Wegovy, and have been religiously training twice a day 5 days/week and once a day the other 2 days. Mixture of 1 hour steady state cardio and another hour of heavy weights for the afternoon session, 1 hour of cardio in the morning. In the first 3 weeks I lost 8kgs. Got to 125kg. Have now been stuck at 125kg for 5 weeks. Have not lost any weight at all in the last 5 weeks.


The last 4 weeks I have been on 1mg Wegovy. 0.5mg was skipped at doctor recommendation, so went from 0.25mg to 1.0mg. Gives me some stomach problems for the first day after injection but fine otherwise. 


The kicker to all this, I've been on 1000 calories or less a day. I have a single meal of 800 calories or less in the evening after my second training session, and 1 tub of yoghurt @ 150 calories. That's it. I fast all day, train fasted, the works. Everything is measured to the gram. Chicken breast, some veggies, some rice. Every fucking day. When I say under 1000 calories per day, I mean it. There is no deviation from this. I supplement my training sessions with a multivitamin. I drink nothing but water. I don't drink alcohol. Don't smoke. No drugs. 


I don't know why I've typed this all out, except to say fuck this. My base metabolic rate should be around 3000 calories per day to maintain my weight. I'm eating less than 1000, training every single fucking day, and for what? The last 5 weeks and not a single kilo lost. Waste of fucking time. Sorry for the rant. This is fucked.

1ewuawe,I_Mean_Not_Really,I've been plateaued for literally years and I want to give up,"I am truly at a loss on what to do now. 

I'm 37, 5'5 tall, and right at 200 lb. So I'm not as big as you probably think I am, I'm just straight up dad bod. But nothing I've done over years and years has gotten rid of this. 

I'm not going to go through the whole history, but I only eat once a day, and sometimes that's just apples, water, string cheese sometimes and some protein powder. And that's usually not until the afternoon. So lots of intermittent fasting.

I work out two to three times a week, I take supplements like l-carnitine, acetyl l-carnitine, omega-3 fatty acids and berberine.

I also have hyperthyroidism. And I've been taking levothyroxine for, probably 15 years if not more. 

This is a routine I've had for years, and I just maintain it best. 

There was a time when I was at the gym almost every single day, working out for up to 2 hours, taking creatine, doing muscle building exercises, doing plenty of cardio. And 6 months of that, I only lost 10 lb. That was maybe 3 years ago.

I'm seriously considering adding something like Wegovy. I am completely fed up.

What's something I can do to avoid that? Is there something I'm missing?

UPDATE: 

A bunch of people have asked so here is my very very typical calorie intake on any given day.

6 apples
16 oz of a fruit and veggie protein shake 
6 individual packets of string cheese 
About 10 cups of water 

So about 1000 calories

Ive been obese all my life and have a hard time caring for myself (i go to therapy but have still pretty much feel like im not worth caring for myself) but i would really like to get under the 300 mark. 

I work a fairly active job. I work at a grocery store so in my everyday i typically walk 5000 steps on a slow day, 7000-10000 steps on a regular day or even 15000+ on a holiday. 

Im not that good of a cook and have mostly ate shit garbage food for the past few years which caused me to gain the 85 lbs since high school. My morbid obesity has taken such a big toll on my mental health, self esteem, and lately my quality of life (very tired, knee pain, hip pain, back pain). I also have high blood pressure, am pre diabetic, and PCOS due to insulin resistance.

I'm 22 years old, I'm 6'4 and 130kg and I have tried and tried to lose weight ever since I moved to college in 2020 at 98kg but it never sticks for longer than 4 months, l'd lose say 35-45lbs in that time then just stop completely and gain it all back.

Normally due to life events eg. Christmas rolls around and I lose momentum and give up...
I'm now at a stage of my life where l've been out of college for a year and been fully self employed as a photographer in the music industry. Spending a lot of time on the road I find it impossible to stay active and eat well so that's another event where if things are going well I self sabotage and just have to start over.
My question basically is how on earth do you balance life, and keep going with fitness and healthy eating. I know exactly what I need to do but as soon as one of my pillars (nutrition, exercise, sleep) fall away then so do all of the others.

Any advice for me you beautiful people? My dad's getting my remarried just before Christmas and I'd love to be in the best shape I can be by then so any advice would be greatly appreciated!

1hcr0bd,ojfincho,"I’ve (31f) have gained weight after trauma, and need advice to turn my life around ","Hi everyone!

Growing up, I was the “chubby kid.” It was just who I was for most of my childhood. When I got to college, I managed to lose weight, and while I wasn’t skinny, I was what people might call “thick.” Then grad school happened, and everything changed.

I became anorexic—almost accidentally. My schedule was so packed that I’d forget to eat, and over the course of a year, I lost 90 pounds. Once I noticed how rapidly the weight was coming off, it became intentional. During that time, I also developed bulimia in my quest to stay thin. My relationship with food and my body became complicated, but eventually, the anorexia and bulimia stopped. By my mid-twenties, I had found a balance. I was eating healthy, working out regularly, and finally felt strong and confident.

But now, at 31, things are different. Two years ago, I experienced something that completely shifted my life. I was sexually assaulted, and I turned to food for comfort. The weight started piling on almost immediately, and I was determined to stop it. My ex and I began doing 30-minute workouts together, and I managed to lose 10-15 pounds. But when our relationship ended, so did the workouts. I lost the accountability and motivation to keep going, and the weight came back.

On top of that, my PCOS kicked into high gear, causing rapid weight gain. I was also in a toxic living situation with an alcoholic and abusive father. During that time, I barely left my room and used food as my escape. Thankfully, I’ve since moved out of that environment and am now back in a city surrounded by friends who support me.

One of my closest friends is getting married in August, and she also wants to lose weight before the big day. We’ve been talking about starting to work out together, which I’m hoping will help me stay consistent.

A few months ago, my doctor prescribed Wegovy, and for the first time in a while, I felt like I was getting back on track. But then I lost my job and had to stop the medication, and since September, I’ve regained about 14 pounds. My health is at risk, and I miss the confidence I once had. I’m tired of how society treats me based on my weight, and I don’t know where to start.

I’m trying to return to old habits that worked—like cooking every meal instead of eating out. I’ve even started using HelloFresh again. This week, I’ve lost two pounds just from eating better. But I have a long road ahead. I need to lose 113 pounds to get back to the weight where I felt strong, healthy, and confident.

Here’s the thing: I hate working out. But when my ex and I used to do those short 30-minute workouts, I could lose weight quickly. I know I can do it because I’ve done it before. I just need guidance on how to start—especially since it’s been so long since I’ve lost weight naturally.

I’d also love tips and tricks on healthy snacking and weight loss in general. I tend to struggle with cravings and portion control, so any advice to keep things manageable would be amazing. Are there any snacks or simple meal prep ideas that work well for people trying to lose weight?

I’d also love advice on how to stick to a healthy routine and incorporate workouts I won’t dread. Are there classes or types of exercise that can help me tone while I lose weight? I have some disposable income, so I’m open to hiring a personal trainer or trying something new.

I just want my health, confidence, and old life back. If anyone has advice or suggestions, I’d truly appreciate it.

Growing up, I was the “chubby kid.” It was just who I was for most of my childhood. When I got to college, I managed to lose weight, and while I wasn’t skinny, I was what people might call “thick.” Then grad school happened, and everything changed.

I became anorexic—almost accidentally. My schedule was so packed that I’d forget to eat, and over the course of a year, I lost 90 pounds. Once I noticed how rapidly the weight was coming off, it became intentional. During that time, I also developed bulimia in my quest to stay thin. My relationship with food and my body became complicated, but eventually, the anorexia and bulimia stopped. By my mid-twenties, I had found a balance. I was eating healthy, working out regularly, and finally felt strong and confident.

But now, at 31, things are different. Two years ago, I experienced something that completely shifted my life. I was sexually assaulted, and I turned to food for comfort. The weight started piling on almost immediately, and I was determined to stop it. My ex and I began doing 30-minute workouts together, and I managed to lose 10-15 pounds. But when our relationship ended, so did the workouts. I lost the accountability and motivation to keep going, and the weight came back.

On top of that, my PCOS kicked into high gear, causing rapid weight gain. I was also in a toxic living situation with an alcoholic and abusive father. During that time, I barely left my room and used food as my escape. Thankfully, I’ve since moved out of that environment and am now back in a city surrounded by friends who support me.

One of my closest friends is getting married in August, and she also wants to lose weight before the big day. We’ve been talking about starting to work out together, which I’m hoping will help me stay consistent.

A few months ago, my doctor prescribed Wegovy, and for the first time in a while, I felt like I was getting back on track. But then I lost my job and had to stop the medication, and since September, I’ve regained about 14 pounds. My health is at risk, and I miss the confidence I once had. I’m tired of how society treats me based on my weight, and I don’t know where to start.

I’m trying to return to old habits that worked—like cooking every meal instead of eating out. I’ve even started using HelloFresh again. This week, I’ve lost two pounds just from eating better. But I have a long road ahead. I need to lose 113 pounds to get back to the weight where I felt strong, healthy, and confident.

Here’s the thing: I hate working out. But when my ex and I used to do those short 30-minute workouts, I could lose weight quickly. I know I can do it because I’ve done it before. I just need guidance on how to start—especially since it’s been so long since I’ve lost weight naturally.

Hey there,
Just stumbled across this subreddit doomscrolling at 1am. Currently wanted to get started on my weight loss journey with my gf and I have no clue where to start. 

I am 23M, 6’1, ~300 lbs, and she is 20F, 5’8 ~200 lbs. We’ve both always been a bit on the chubbier side all our lives. There was a time in my life roughly 7 ish years ago when I cut gluten and dairy out of my diet completely due to gastrointestinal issues, and immediately the pounds flew off. I got down to a point where I don’t even recognize myself in pictures anymore compared to my current self. As time progressed, this weight slowly pilled back on and on, to where we are now. 

When my girlfriend and I had first met, she was a bit lighter, she was in a state physically where she was happy with her body and how she looked. She loved to dress in different outfits, take pictures of herself, etc. During the first half of our relationship (approx. 4 months or so), she was vaping frequently, and I believe it acted as an artificial appetite suppressant, as she hardly ate anything all day, just drinking tons of water and light snacking here and there. After she decided to quit vaping, I believe is when the weight gain started. Progressively after that point in time, she began to mention more and more about noticing herself gaining weight in areas (i.e less defined jawline, wider waist, more tummy, etc). 

It is currently at a point where she is disgusted with how she looks and feels absolutely grossed out in her own skin. She now hates going out as much, says that none of her clothes fit her anymore, doesn’t take pictures of herself anymore, and sometimes gets emotional when thinking about it. As described, it’s making changes to her lifestyle, enjoyment she gets out of things, sex drive, general mood, etc. and it breaks my heart. 

I am not in a similar state as her where I hate how I look so deeply. Sure, I am unhappy with my body, but not to the degree she is unhappy with hers. To clarify, I have no issues with my girlfriend or her weight or how she looks, I love every single bit of her and I wouldn’t change a thing. However, I see how she feels about herself and I want to help her feel comfortable with herself again, and I want to do it along with her, together. 

Currently, she tries to watch what she eats, but will occasionally binge eat or eat too much, and then sometimes purge as a result. Her water intake is still good, I just want to find something for us to do that sticks and we can stay consistent with. 

I have taken a couple first steps myself by seeing a weight loss specialist (after several months of waiting due to appointment availability) for an initial evaluation and questions. We discussed the possibility of medication, and gave me information to go to with insurance. Insurance doesn’t cover it in a way that makes it affordable (roughly $500/month for Zepbound or Wegovy). I have an appointment with a dietician in a couple of days, and I have a couple days of calorie counting to show as my “homework”. I also was advised to get A1C Blood Testing done for further insurance coverage. Depending on how that all goes, I may have some more options for myself. 

As for her, her insurance doesn’t cover medication at all, and she currently doesn’t have a primary practitioner, only a doctor she sees when needed through family Union benefits. I want to try and find her a weight loss specialist or dietician in her network, but even with my insurance, it was funky finding coverage for the dietician appointments. 

What initial steps/advice does anyone have to get started or changes to make off the bat? Any and all advice is appreciated!

1gbkl75,LocozillaYT,My weight-loss journey & some questions. Help definitely welcome.,"Hello Everyone,

I'm new to this sub-reddit. Quick rundown on myself. I was involved in a high speed motorcycle accident years ago, I was the dumb ass that thought ""I'm only going to lunch, this isn't a long ride"" with it being the end of July and over 100° F at the time, I was also the dumb ass that was on a sport bike wearing only a t-shirt, shorts and some airforce ones thinking nothing is going to happen on a 20 minute ride.

Long story short I was cut off on the expressway going 80MPH and when i slammed on my brakes I went over the windshield at 80MPH and well after tumbling, rolling, sliding and tossed around I ended up in the hospital with 60% of my skin gone, and permanent back, hip & knee injuries (I also have permanent nerve damage in both feet, both legs and parts of my back). Before my accident I was 6'2"" @ 205lbs and in the gym 4 days a week. After my accident though I was in the hospital for nearly a month and bed bound and home cared for about 5 months. After my open wounds healed though I still obviously dealt with my back, hip & knee injuries (the nerve damage also causes a good amount of pain on days as well). The injuries caused me so much pain that I wasn't able to be in the gym and frankly hard to move at all.

After that accident I spiraled into horrible depression and ended up gaining wayyyyy to much weight over the years. I have been working on myself mentally over the years to deal with the depression but now I am 6'2"" and 400lbs , so now that I am good with myself mentally it is long over due to work on myself physically! So I wanted to come to this sub-reddit and get any helpful hints or tips to do just that!

About 4.5-5 months ago I was 450lbs, starting June (2024) I started a much needed diet where I cut out all sugar drinks and cut out most sweets and my diet is now something I am mindful about everyday. I try to stick with grilled chicken or tuna & usually a salad with light low fat dressings. I feel like my diet is something I have a decent hold on, and since June (2024) I have lost 50lbs​ in that 4.5-5 months time but now I need to get the exercise part of my life under control now! My only problem is that I still deal with the back, hip and knee pain (my left knee actually needs a total knee replacement but my doctor wants me to lose the weight first). So I need to find the best exercises that I can do with low impact, right now all I have is the resistance bands. I want to put together a exercise plan that will be best for me and figured I would reach out to this sub-reddit to get any hints and tips on what else I should do as well. I want to starting going on longer and longer walks everyday as well. Also side note, I even tried to get prescribed WeGovy (which is a Ozempic like medication) because I really need to ditch this weight as fast as possible so I can get the much needed Total Knee Replacement surgery asap. Unfortunately my insurance rejected the medication, so all the weight-loss so far is natural without medication but to be honest my doctor is still trying to get my insurance to approve that medication and if they actually approve it I will take it, so just wanted to be honest with ya'll. I just want to lose what I can as fast as I can for the surgery I need, after the surgery though I am not sure if I'll stick with the medication or not I guess it all comes down to how well it works and how it makes me feel.

One other thing I would like some input on is which fitness tracker would be best for me as well, because I want to do more & more with my walks,(with my fucked up left knee the walks are rough but I get as far as I can with my cane) one important thing is I want a fitness tracker with GPS so I can track my progression. I am however on a budget, I run my own business but because of the pain lately my business has been hurting just as much as my back, hip & knees lol (its just been rough getting through the work day with the pain), so I would like to keep the fitness tracker under $90 if possible. I think I have it down to 5 to pick from (the FitBit Charge 6 is $140 or so on Amazon but I found a few on ebay for under $90-$100). If you folks would like to take a look at the 5 options and let me know which is best that would help me out as well or maybe I missed a better option under $90. I know there are SOOO many different options when it comes to fitness trackers and a lot of the better ones are over $150, so I know these aren't ""top of the line"" options, but it's what I have to work within my under $90 budget, so if there is something I missed please let me know.

● Fitbit Charge 6

● Amazfit GTR 3

●Amazfit GTR Mini

●Amazfit Bip 5

● Fitbit Inspire 3 (this one I will probably pass on because I don't believe it has a GPS but i've heard good things about it so was wondering what everyone else thought compared to the others)

Thanks in advance for any help you guys give. I wish I never got to this point, but now that I have, it is now time to turn that around! So any tips you folks can give to me for low impact exercises or other tips I should know, everything would be helpful. If there is anything I missed or should have mentioned please let me know that as well. After losing 60% of my skin I do have a lot of scars and thin skin but I don't think any of that should affect my exercising, the thing hardest for me right now is my left knee, because that knee is basically bone on bone until my surgery I will just need to push through that pain to loss the weight so I am able to get the Total Knee Replacement surgery that is needed to fix that problem. The back and hip pain though is something I feel like I can push through as long as I don't over do anything.

Thanks again,

I (29f) am ready to have another baby. However, I currently weigh 304 lbs and want to lose at least 80 lbs before getting pregnant again. I had a miscarriage earlier this year and want to go into this next pregnancy from a healthier spot.

At this point I would honestly just like to lose as much weight as quickly is possibly safe so that I can move forward with trying to conceive. I don’t want to wait years because as I get older that can mean more/different risks.

xgtpr0,celoplyr,I did it!!! -25% of body weight in about a year.,"So I weighed myself this morning and after 6 weeks of being about 185, im now 181. That’s 60 pounds down in a year from my 241 (im 5’2” 39F). 

Like many chronically overweight people I thought I could never really lose the weight. I went down 40 pounds before COVID, gained it all back by being pretty depressed and now I’m down lower than I’ve been in a decade. Heck, I’m even under my drivers license weight ;)

How did I do it? I joined a bariatric clinic. I found a system that I thought would work for me and I said “this is my last resort”. I didn’t want to do surgery, because I’ve seen how difficult surgery can be. It was appetite suppressants and meal replacements. I stopped the meds pretty quickly because they made me feel really jittery, but kept the meal replacements. I lost the first 40 pounds in ~6 months. 

After COVID I had tried almost every prescribed drug out there, and wegovy had come out. I also had a lot of other health issues (I’ve lost my gallbladder and my appendix in 2020, yay me!) so insurance covered it. That’s what I needed to make it “easy” and I’ve been on it since June of last year, and I started losing weight around this time last year due to titrating up the dose. Sometimes I go back on the meal replacements (although I’m not as strict as I was). 

The other thing I did that really is important is weight loss therapy. Get the learned behaviors of emotional eating and I’ll always be fat and no one will love me skinny, etc out of my head. 

Cons of this way? It’s expensive. I have the money to do it, but it’s ~$300 for meds and doc, $400 for therapy and ~$500 for food a month. (Plus the money for new clothes!! New clothes that become too big quickly!)

Anyways, we all have different journeys. If you’re struggling, keep at it, try new things and I hope you find the “easy” way to do it. East is in quotes because it’s never easy, but hopefully one way clicks for you.",309,13,2022-09-17T23:50:32,WeightLossAdvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/xgtpr0/i_did_it_25_of_body_weight_in_about_a_year/,0.99,True,/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/xgtpr0/i_did_it_25_of_body_weight_in_about_a_year/,2025-10-27T19:10:59.337328,"I did it!!! -25% of body weight in about a year.

I didn’t want to do surgery, because I’ve seen how difficult surgery can be. It was appetite suppressants and meal replacements. I stopped the meds pretty quickly because they made me feel really jittery, but kept the meal replacements. I lost the first 40 pounds in ~6 months. 

After COVID I had tried almost every prescribed drug out there, and wegovy had come out. I also had a lot of other health issues (I’ve lost my gallbladder and my appendix in 2020, yay me!) so insurance covered it. That’s what I needed to make it “easy” and I’ve been on it since June of last year, and I started losing weight around this time last year due to titrating up the dose. Sometimes I go back on the meal replacements (although I’m not as strict as I was). 

The other thing I did that really is important is weight loss therapy. Get the learned behaviors of emotional eating and I’ll always be fat and no one will love me skinny, etc out of my head. 

Cons of this way? It’s expensive. I have the money to do it, but it’s ~$300 for meds and doc, $400 for therapy and ~$500 for food a month. (Plus the money for new clothes!! New clothes that become too big quickly!)

Anyways, we all have different journeys. If you’re struggling, keep at it, try new things and I hope you find the “easy” way to do it. East is in quotes because it’s never easy, but hopefully one way clicks for you.",body weight year weigh morning pound year like many chronically overweight people think could never really lose weight pound covid gain back pretty depressed low decade heck even driver license weight join bariatric clinic find system think would work say last resort want surgery see difficult surgery appetite suppressant meal replacement stop med pretty quickly make feel really jittery keep meal replacement lose first pound covid try almost every prescribed drug wegovy come also lot health issue lose gallbladder appendix yay insurance cover need make easy since june last year start lose weight around time last year due titrate dose sometimes back meal replacement although strict thing really important weight loss therapy get learn behavior emotional eating always fat one love skinny etc head con way expensive money med doc therapy food plus money new clothe new clothe become big quickly anyways different journey struggle keep try new thing hope find easy way east quote never easy hopefully one way click,"['body', 'weight', 'year', 'weigh', 'morning', 'pound', 'year', 'like', 'many', 'chronically', 'overweight', 'people', 'think', 'could', 'never', 'really', 'lose', 'weight', 'pound', 'covid', 'gain', 'back', 'pretty', 'depressed', 'low', 'decade', 'heck', 'even', 'driver', 'license', 'weight', 'join', 'bariatric', 'clinic', 'find', 'system', 'think', 'would', 'work', 'say', 'last', 'resort', 'want', 'surgery', 'see', 'difficult', 'surgery', 'appetite', 'suppressant', 'meal', 'replacement', 'stop', 'med', 'pretty', 'quickly', 'make', 'feel', 'really', 'jittery', 'keep', 'meal', 'replacement', 'lose', 'first', 'pound', 'covid', 'try', 'almost', 'every', 'prescribed', 'drug', 'wegovy', 'come', 'also', 'lot', 'health', 'issue', 'lose', 'gallbladder', 'appendix', 'yay', 'insurance', 'cover', 'need', 'make', 'easy', 'since', 'june', 'last', 'year', 'start', 'lose', 'weight', 'around', 'time', 'last', 'year', 'due', 'titrate', 'dose', 'sometimes', 'back', 'meal', 'replacement', 'although', 'strict', 'thing', 'really', 'important', 'weight', 'loss', 'therapy', 'get', 'learn', 'behavior', 'emotional', 'eating', 'always', 'fat', 'one', 'love', 'skinny', 'etc', 'head', 'con', 'way', 'expensive', 'money', 'med', 'doc', 'therapy', 'food', 'plus', 'money', 'new', 'clothe', 'new', 'clothe', 'become', 'big', 'quickly', 'anyways', 'different', 'journey', 'struggle', 'keep', 'try', 'new', 'thing', 'hope', 'find', 'easy', 'way', 'east', 'quote', 'never', 'easy', 'hopefully', 'one', 'way', 'click']",161,post,xgtpr0

1c2qx5r,Booseygirl,I don’t know where to start. ,"33 years old, female, 325lbs or so. Goal weight is 125lbs. 

I was recently diagnosed with PCOS and Endometriosis and will be starting Wegovy once my health benefits kick in at my new job. I work at a desk job so not much movement other than me being alive right now. 

I’ve been cutting out everything and eating portion sizes as close as possible. We cook at home and usually only eat out once a week or so. Desserts I’ve limited to once or twice a week (a single serving size or as close to). Not snacking, and if I do, it’s usually on fruit. 

We’ve been cooking more healthily at home and I’m starting to feel much more full after just eating dinner. I did intermittent fasting for a long time and now I don’t typically get hungry until 11am or 12pm, so I usually eat lunch and dinner. I’ve been drinking water, Coke Zero, or other diet drinks we buy or when I go out. 

I feel like I’m not seeing any weight loss whatsoever. I signed up for a Y membership but I don’t know what to do. In school, I was always told that girls do cardio, so that’s all I can really do. I don’t know where to start with other routines. My arms and legs are my biggest issue, they’re the largest parts of me. I’m smaller in the middle. 

I guess im just looking for advice, work out routines, and just general help for what I can do to start losing weight. I don’t want to be this way anymore and I’m so tired of it.

I feel like I’m not seeing any weight loss whatsoever. I signed up for a Y membership but I don’t know what to do. In school, I was always told that girls do cardio, so that’s all I can really do. I don’t know where to start with other routines. My arms and legs are my biggest issue, they’re the largest parts of me. I’m smaller in the middle. 

I guess im just looking for advice, work out routines, and just general help for what I can do to start losing weight. I don’t want to be this way anymore and I’m so tired of it.

1e6dck2,PrestigiousRemove595,How do I stop binging ,"I’ve been slowly gaining weight over the past 3 years. I went from 160 to 215 lbs as a 5’6 woman, the most I’ve ever weighed. I weight lift pretty regularly I would say about 3-4 times a week, however I do struggle with maintaining a calorie deficit as I struggle with binge eating - we’re working on that. I just seem to have a problem controlling my appetite and the food noise and find myself binging on the weekends. 

I recently started lexapro 10mg about 6 months ago and have gained 15 lbs since then. Lexapro has definitely helped with my underlying anxiety but I feel like it has contributed to my increased appetite. 

I’ve started including cardio into my workouts now - anything from 12-3-30 to daily walks. I want to avoid ozempic/wegovy although my pcp does recommend and even prescribed it. Is there any natural appetite suppressant to help calm the food noise/binge eating or just any advice in general

1h42fbh,Past_Court_1344,NEED HELP!!!,"I have a fatal flaw: when I see food I eat it! 
[EDIT: i eat without realizing it]

My hubby used to work 12 hour days (he’s in healthcare so his job doesn't have to follow regular worker safety standards) so when he was at work, i’d put away all the food & only have a light lunch after work. That worked really well & I lost 25 lbs. But it never addressed the core problem. 

However, a couple months ago, he got an office job and his office has a space shortage so he has to work from home indefinitely. He’s also a skinny guy so now that his job isn't as physically or mentally taxing, he’s trying to bulk. 

As a result, i’m constantly in the kitchen cooking him meals or bringing him snacks. And as we’ve established, I have no self control so when I see food, I eat it! I’ve almost gained all the weight back - 1.5 years of work undone in 3 months! 

More considerations: 
- calorie counting sends me into a very unhealthy spiral
- I work retail so i’m constantly on my feet. I view working as steady state cardio because i’m basically fast walking for my entire shift. I try to workout after work but I usually don't have the energy. 
- lol my insurance won’t cover ozempic or wegovy unless my weight is literally killing me & at the moment, I don’t appear to be dying
- yes, I do have untreated adhd. I was diagnosed as a kid by a psychiatrist but my shitty family doctor convinced my parents i’m fine & big pharma is just trying to push drugs on kids. I’ve since got a better doctor but he needs record of that diagnosis (which I'm struggling to find because it was so long ago) or a new diagnosis ($$$$$)

1bh7ejl,Safe-Parsley3184,Ozempic Shame ,"If you can, I’d like as little judgement as possible when interacting with this post. Please be kind. Also kind of a long read and maybe triggering. 

I(21f) have obsessed over my weight for most of my life. It started at 7, maybe 8 years old and my earliest, most emotionally charged memories is of older adults criticising my looks. These people weren’t my family, my family has always been kind, but it still had a a massive impact.
So naturally, the desire to be skinny is imbedded within me. It makes up a huge, silent part of who I am.

At my most active: walking to and from school, playing 2 sports, multiple extra-curriculars, trying to keep portions at bay, I was still fat. About 72kg on a 165cm frame. 

I always noticed other people’s interactions with food. So calm and relaxed. Desiring something sometimes, chaotic at times but ultimately intuitive. I, on the other hand, always feel… intense when it comes to food. When I engage with food it’s intense. I want to involve food with everything; Emotions, boredom, studying, relaxing. And when I’m not engaging with food I’m always thinking about it. It’s always buzzing in the background. Always. 

What’s embarrassing is that I’ve always wanted to be anorexic. It seemed like the better, more appropriate eating disorder to have. (P.s. I don’t want to be told to go to therapy, I’ve already tried all of that. I I don’t want to be told to go to therapy, I’ve already tried all of that.) When I was younger, I would listen to any tip that I could find, from the healthiest to the most disordered but my desire for food would trump all, no matter what, I would always stay fat. 

I’m now 85kg on a 165cm frame. BMI = >30. I know that extreme restricting doesn’t work so I’m currently in a reasonable calorie deficit (my umpteenth attempt at losing weight this way). 1300 - 1600 calories per day, some days lower, some higher. Lifting heavy in the gym for muscle. An hours walk everyday and some additional cardio on other days per week. Volume eating. Meal prepping. 6-8 hours of sleep every night— yet the buzzing persists. When I wake up, when I go to bed, while I eat, bathe, everything. 

It’s taking up all my energy, both conscious and unconscious, to keep up with losing weight. I worry that even if I reach my goal weight, my entire life will be spent ruminating, obsessing and living life surrounding my weight.

I got diagnosed with ADHD a year ago and tried a few stimulant medications. They didn’t work for me in the long term but once side-effect I did notice was the buzzing quiet. It was the most bizarre I got diagnosed with ADHD a year ago and tried a few stimulant medications. They didn’t work for me in the long term but one side-effect I did notice was the buzzing going quiet. It was the most bizarre satisfying things I’ve ever felt. 

I see a lot of people who’ve gone on Wegovy or ozempic, talking about “the quiet” — The food noise  finally disappearing. I’m well aware of shortages in medication for people with diabetes and would never use it while this occurs, but I’ve been thinking about the future when stock for people with diabetes and for people who need to lose weight is sufficient and I think I want to get on the medication for weight loss. 
For some reason though, this makes me feel extremely shameful and guilty and those feelings make me angry because why do I feel that way?

Why do I feel shame for wanting silence? 
Why do I feel like I’m cheating or lazy for desiring a less tumultuous relationship with my food? 
Why do I feel guilty for wanting to be skinny? 

I’m very confused and conflicted about my feelings and honestly just wanted to vent and see if anyone relates and could possibly shed light on why I am thinking this way.

1fht213,Murphinator__,Trying to lose a serious amount of weight,"As the title of the thread suggests I am trying to lose a lot of weight. About 15 or 16 months ago I was injured at work. I was run over by a piece of equipment  (driver on cellphone) and was badly injured. I spent 4 months not being able to move and another 5 in recovery before I could walk unassisted. When I was in the hospital via X Rays they found that my Thyroid was enlarged due to a ""Goiter"". I was given a drug that was supposed to shrink the Goiter and while it did its job it threw my hormones out of whack and it caused me to gain a serious amount of weight in the last year. I was told this would happen and I watched what I ate but beings as how I couldnt move for over 9 months I gained quite a bit of weight. I was already a heavy person before all of this (6'4"" 248lbs) now I am 344lbs. I have since been off that Thyroid Goiter shrink medication and have started going back to work. I have lost 24 pounds in the past 3 months. I however need to work harder to put the weight off faster. I would like to lose at least 100 pounds by March 1st of 2025 as that would be 2 years since my whole life went upside down. I would like to get myself down to around 230 to 235 by then and hopefully go further to about 200lbs. I got a gym membership and I am going to start doing a Calorie Defecit Diet of 800 to 1200 calories a day. I work a physically intensive manual labor job working on large trucks and equipment and I will incorporate weight lifting and cardio into my gym routine. What is a good work out starting point. My doc says to take it easy as my right knee still isnt 100% neither is my left foot. I was told by a fella at the gym that 500 steps on the step machine, 5 min sprints on the treadmill and some time on the eliptical are a good start. I used to bench 225 quite regularly but I will start back at 180 and work my way back up until I know I am 100% healed same with the squat rack i used to easily squat 425lbs but the other day I could barely do 245lbs. Getting run over isnt good for your health lol. Anyway is this a good start to meet my goal in March 2025 ? Just trying to lose about 100~110lbs to start. If anyone has some tips lay em down. So far my physician wants to go with Ozempic or Wegovy and I dont trust medications not after what I went through with that Thyroid medication.

1gd2jfk,JennyJ0522,Medications for Weight Loss?,"My husband was already overweight, but after marrying me, he gained even more weight and now has a BMI over 32, putting him in the obese range. The only exercise he does is walking our dog for about an hour a day, and he absolutely loves eating, especially fried foods and desserts like ice cream and cake. Sometimes, it feels like he genuinely can’t control his appetite.

My concern has shifted from just his appearance to his health. His sleep apnea has worsened to the point that he’s recently started using a CPAP machine, and while he doesn’t have high blood pressure yet, it’s a bit above normal. His doctor has recommended he lose some weight, but he doesn’t seem to be making any effort to do so. It’s like he has no motivation at all. Right now, he doesn’t appear to have any serious health issues because he’s still relatively young, but I worry that in a few years, he’ll inevitably develop hypertension and diabetes.

I’m wondering how I could help him find motivation to lose weight, and I thought about the possibility of using medication like Wegovy initially, to help kickstart his weight loss journey. The idea would be to combine it with a balanced diet and exercise with me.

My weight loss slowed after the first month/joining the gym. I met with my coach today and we noticed that a lot of my measurements/bf% have actually gone up in the last month, so we did a deeper diver into my nutrition. I am usually eating about 1500-1600 calories and \~100-120g of protein per day. My coach seems to think this is not enough food to fuel my weight loss, especially with the recent increase in activity. He suggested that I should be eating closer to 2500-2700 per day with more than 200g of protein. This honestly doesn't really feel achievable for me though. Especially with the Wegovy in the mix, which suppresses my appetite a lot. It also makes me REALLY NERVOUS because the idea of increasing my calories by like 1000 per day seems super counterintuitive to everything I know about weight loss.

I met with my coach today and we noticed that a lot of my measurements/bf% have actually gone up in the last month, so we did a deeper diver into my nutrition. I am usually eating about 1500-1600 calories and \~100-120g of protein per day. My coach seems to think this is not enough food to fuel my weight loss, especially with the recent increase in activity. He suggested that I should be eating closer to 2500-2700 per day with more than 200g of protein. This honestly doesn't really feel achievable for me though. Especially with the Wegovy in the mix, which suppresses my appetite a lot. It also makes me REALLY NERVOUS because the idea of increasing my calories by like 1000 per day seems super counterintuitive to everything I know about weight loss. Am I being silly or is my trainer crazy (or maybe a little bit of both)?",coach say need eat make really nervous weight loss journey also wegovy pco pre diabetes lose pound first join gym get coach trainer help build muscle lose weight weight loss slow first join gym meet coach today notice lot measurement actually last deep diver nutrition usually eat calorie protein per coach seem think enough food fuel weight loss especially recent increase activity suggest eat close per protein honestly really feel achievable though especially wegovy mix suppress appetite lot also make really nervous idea increase calorie like per seem super everything know weight loss silly trainer crazy maybe little bit,"['coach', 'say', 'need', 'eat', 'make', 'really', 'nervous', 'weight', 'loss', 'journey', 'also', 'wegovy', 'pco', 'pre', 'diabetes', 'lose', 'pound', 'first', 'join', 'gym', 'get', 'coach', 'trainer', 'help', 'build', 'muscle', 'lose', 'weight', 'weight', 'loss', 'slow', 'first', 'join', 'gym', 'meet', 'coach', 'today', 'notice', 'lot', 'measurement', 'actually', 'last', 'deep', 'diver', 'nutrition', 'usually', 'eat', 'calorie', 'protein', 'per', 'coach', 'seem', 'think', 'enough', 'food', 'fuel', 'weight', 'loss', 'especially', 'recent', 'increase', 'activity', 'suggest', 'eat', 'close', 'per', 'protein', 'honestly', 'really', 'feel', 'achievable', 'though', 'especially', 'wegovy', 'mix', 'suppress', 'appetite', 'lot', 'also', 'make', 'really', 'nervous', 'idea', 'increase', 'calorie', 'like', 'per', 'seem', 'super', 'everything', 'know', 'weight', 'loss', 'silly', 'trainer', 'crazy', 'maybe', 'little', 'bit']",99,post,1ff9ofr
1fp7vmx,dposd21,Looking for some guidance,"Summary: How many calories to aim for at lunch?

Hello all. I am a 6'2 male that currently weighs 260lbs. Trying to figure out how much I should be eating. 

In late February I got serious about my weight loss and started taking wegovy (at max dose now) and exercising 5x week (3 days of rowing machine for 40min and 2 days of walking on treadmill for 45min). I was 330ish lbs at the time and have lost about 70lbs since. Looking to be around 240 come Thanksgiving and maybe get down to 200ish sometime later and then maintain.

I usually eat 3 maybe 4 times a day. For breakfast I have a protein shake and 2 large coffee with french vanilla creamer, dinners vary but I usually consume 400-600ish calories. Lunch is kinda what I'm trying to figure out. I was eating about 300ish worth of calories but wondering if I should try and eat more (maybe 500-600)?

1cao06a,hom84164-cdfaq,How do I help my mother lose weight?,"Hi folks, I’m here about my mother.
(I’d like to clarify she’s asked for my help and advice on this since she can’t find anything herself online, and her doctors have all told her “starve or suffer” with this.)

My mother is around 45, and has both PCOS and Thyroid issues. She’s on a few different mood stabilisers and she’s on birth control. Within the past 10 years, she’s slowly and surely gained weight no matter what she does. 

She’s tried keto, borderline starved herself with that, and gained weight. She’s tried calorie counting, high protein, vegetarian, everything we could find, and she’s either gained weight at a slightly slower rate, been unaffected, or gained weight.

Recently, she was taken off a medicine that extrapolated that (and is slowly weening off of it, as it’s a mood stabiliser) and was advised to visit an endo to see about weight loss. He told her she should never eat carbs if she wants to lose weight, needs 70g of protein a day, and needs to run at least an hour a day. He also said that if that doesn’t work, she can forget it. This is what pushed her to ask me if I’ve seen anything online, and to post here.

My mother’s time is incredibly limited, as her days usually consist of Wake up>Work>Go home at dinner>have an hour to herself (that she’s always exhausted during)>sleep. Weekends aren’t much better, as Sat she visits my dad/does chores (which I help with, but I can’t do everything), and Sunday she goes to church and rests. We’ve gotten an indoor walking pad, but it’s not the best as we got it secondhand, and barely goes above a stroll. 

Is there anything I can advise her to do? I’ve already recommended she get a new Endo, but the area I live in isn’t known for having the best doctors.

1ewcp3n,Calm_Bullfrog5363,Thinking about weight loss medication (seeking support),"Hi All! It’s funny, I saw I posted a question around one year ago about seeking support. I started in July of 2022 at 430 pounds. Last year, I was 367 pounds. This year at this time, I’m at 326 pounds. It’s been consistent throughout the last two years. A lot of balancing intuitive eating, journaling, increasing activity, and trauma work surrounding emotional eating. It’s great progress! 

My weight loss doctor shared how I should celebrate my achievements. I was thinking about it. Over the last two years, its been constant pros and cons about food, journaling (difficult balancing obsessive and avoidant), checking in with my body on what it needs, meeting those needs, and learning about me. Most of that being what will need to continue, I mainly am tired of the mental energy required for meeting nutrient requirements and pros and cons. My bloodwork looks the best it ever has. I’m tired. Not all the time. But today, I am tired. 

Taking medicine is not weak. Taking medicine doesn’t mean I’m giving up. Part of me wants to celebrate by asking for a prescription for medicine like wegovy or ozempic (I know my doctor can refuse or ask questions to verify if it will be the right choice for me). The goal would be to push me to my final goal of weight loss for this time in my life; pushing me from around 1 pound a week to 2 pounds a week of weight loss. Im 6’5”. My goal being 225 and around 18% fat on my body. Right now, my scale says 39% (it started at 48% body fat). 

When I’m seeking support: I mainly am asking does this make sense? I’m open to people challenging it because there are so many factors to consider. 

Also, it’s not about aesthetics entirely. I want to look good. I also want to ride roller coasters and not worry about if I can fit. I want to fit comfortably in a plane seat (as much as possible). I want to not have to go to special stores for clothing. I want to be able to run efficiently without worrying about joint damage.

1g9icfs,beansproutandbug,Been stuck for months,"I've been stuck at the same weight (230 lbs) since March. Last year around this time I decided to really make a change. I took two weeks to really track what I ate without adjusting at all. I ate an average 2300 calories with a high of 3600 and a low of 1600. Without any guidance I restricted to a range of 1700-1800. I dropped weight pretty fast and pretty easily. Losing 1-2 pounds a week until March where it plateaued. 

I started PT for my knee in May. I fell off the tracking wagon in June/July, but didn't gain much. In August I hopped back on tracking, finally met with a weight loss physician. Got a DEXA and RMR scan to see how much fat I have, where it is and how many calories I burn resting. It was 1600 calories. So my weight specialist guided me to go down to 1500, on days I exercise more 1600 and when I couch potato 1400. 


I'm still in PT and have started seeing massive improvements. The exercise made me feel better. My partner's mom was getting rid of her excercise bike so I got it and being able to just walk to another room in my PJs instead of getting up and ready and going somewhere else made it so much easier to be motivated to exercise so I started working out every day, with active rest days to give my body a break. In September, I started Wegovy. Not cause I don't believe its possible to lose the weight without, but because I'm on a time crunch. I need to lose 40 more pounds to get a breast reduction, and have a year and half before I lose health insurance. I need 6 months for the surgery and recovery time. So i need to lose 40 lbs in the next year. 

I feel much better. I feel more stronger and more energetic. Even little things like actually squatting down for things instead of sitting or bending.

I recently started on Wegovy and I've been reading about their whole recommended diet. For someone who's too picky to do that, I'd really like to find some sort of meal replacement or other way of ""eating"" without actually eating. I would appreciate some thoughts on this!",eat much nothing try lose weight diet exercise try incorporate generally healthy living daily life big issue though eating enjoy food way make gross ingredient gross happen ingest gross feel gross digest even get start animal product like food outside couple occasional thing start get headache feel well come full circle overeat struggle find middle ground eat much still get nutrition usually consume calorie back overeating really want form balanced spread nutrition keep sickness headache away still require eat whole meal recently start wegovy read whole recommend diet someone picky really like find sort meal replacement way eat without actually eat would appreciate thought,"['eat', 'much', 'nothing', 'try', 'lose', 'weight', 'diet', 'exercise', 'try', 'incorporate', 'generally', 'healthy', 'living', 'daily', 'life', 'big', 'issue', 'though', 'eating', 'enjoy', 'food', 'way', 'make', 'gross', 'ingredient', 'gross', 'happen', 'ingest', 'gross', 'feel', 'gross', 'digest', 'even', 'get', 'start', 'animal', 'product', 'like', 'food', 'outside', 'couple', 'occasional', 'thing', 'start', 'get', 'headache', 'feel', 'well', 'come', 'full', 'circle', 'overeat', 'struggle', 'find', 'middle', 'ground', 'eat', 'much', 'still', 'get', 'nutrition', 'usually', 'consume', 'calorie', 'back', 'overeating', 'really', 'want', 'form', 'balanced', 'spread', 'nutrition', 'keep', 'sickness', 'headache', 'away', 'still', 'require', 'eat', 'whole', 'meal', 'recently', 'start', 'wegovy', 'read', 'whole', 'recommend', 'diet', 'someone', 'picky', 'really', 'like', 'find', 'sort', 'meal', 'replacement', 'way', 'eat', 'without', 'actually', 'eat', 'would', 'appreciate', 'thought']",104,post,1e7k51x

1bzsh80,Gentei0075,Question about diabetes and Ozempic vs Rybelsus,"Hello

I was diagnosed with diabetes T2 at about 5 years ago it was managed first by regular pills as metformine and other ones I forgot.

About 2 years ago they stoped working, my GP sent me to a  endocrinologist, after some physical exams he put me on Ozempic, first 0.2 then 0.5 and then 1.0mg.  
for the first time in a long time my blood sugars dropped quickly i even had cases where my sugar droped to low were i would get a warning that it was too low.

I also lost a lot of weight.  
Then last year the problems started with availability of Ozempic (i'm from the EU)  
The doctor put me on Rybelsus 14mg (highest available dose)  
i take one pil every day on a empty stomach and wait before eating something usally a few hours.  
but since january i'm noticing my sugar levels going high again.  
the problem is that the sugar doest really drop anymore, i've done some tests on days where I don't even anything anything just drink water and they barely drop. it almost hover around the same.

at a bad day they are can be between 150-190 mg/dl and almost stay there the whole day.  
on a good day it's around 110-130 which is according to the measuring machine ok.  
And yes I watch what I eat, i do at least 30-60 mins of cardio mostly 4 times a week.

I have a appointment next month with my endocrinologist, but I already sent him a mail about this.  
his response was that Rybelsus is not as strong as Ozempic but it's kinda weird. Everywhere when you look up online for Rybelsus it's being said that it works the same as Ozempic and is a good replacment for Ozempic.  
However I seem to be hungier on Rybelsus then i was on Ozempic. 

So my question is did anyone else had this problem where they switched to Rybelsus and had a increase in their blood sugar?  
it's kinda weird that my sugar was prefectly fine under Ozempic and now  with Rybelsus it's being messed up.  
i've been using Rybelsus since october last year and it was also fine untill now january. i'm also taking Metformin along with it but I did as well for Ozempic.",3,5,2024-04-09T19:11:26,diabetes_t2,https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes_t2/comments/1bzsh80/question_about_diabetes_and_ozempic_vs_rybelsus/,1.0,True,/r/diabetes_t2/comments/1bzsh80/question_about_diabetes_and_ozempic_vs_rybelsus/,2025-10-27T19:12:22.829616,"Question about diabetes and Ozempic vs Rybelsus Hello

xo29mr,notreallylucy,weight loss on Mounjaro vs. Ozempic/Rybelsus,"I was on Ozempic for three (ish) years until I learned about Rybelsus. I switched to Rybelsus because it was easier for me to store and administer. I've found them both to be about equally effective.

I've lost about 45 pounds in that time. I've been working hard with diet and exercise in addition to the medication. I've hit a bit of a plateau. I'd like to lose another 20-30 pounds. I'm 5'2"",41 years old, and currently weigh 203 pounds, last a1c was 7.1, so that's a reasonable amount of weight for me to lose. 

My FIL started taking Mounjaro and has lost a lot of weight. I looked it up and it's similar to Ozempic and Rybelsus, but works on more parts of the brain. I want to know if anyone here has been on both and has found one or the other (Ozempic VS mounjaro) more effective for weight loss. I'm fortunate to have insurance where the cost for these is about the same.

1n5cwvr,MedusaSteele,Advice on Food Aversion,"Hey y’all! 

Sorry if this doesn’t seem like the proper place for this, but here I go. So, I live in California and I’ve now come to realize that the fires earlier in the year mentally threw me off more than I originally realized. I had to evacuate (thankfully I didn’t lose anything) and although I was with a friend and her family, it was still a mind breaking moment that made me feel unstable and isolated. Unfortunately, I’m now realizing that it set the tone for my mental state for this year: unstable and isolated.

Last year I was working out regularly, not doing too well with food, but I was trying hello fresh and factor, etc. I had an appetite for sure, and I was more balanced. This year, after what happened in January, I’ve found that doing ANYTHING for myself is like Sisyphus rolling that boulder up a mountain. It’s gotten significantly worse over the months. I went from being able to eat meals to not even having the mental strength to move a prepared meal from its container to a plate just to heat it up in the microwave. It’s not that I don’t want a healthy meal, it’s that I don’t want ANY meal. Any time I force myself to eat, whether it’s a salmon dinner or idk Wendy’s, I take maybe three bites and give up. 

I find that I can snack on small things every once in a while (almonds, cubes of cheese, fruits) but rarely a full meal. Example: I’ve only had applesauce today because the berries I was gonna eat had gotten old. I get the urge to eat a full meal, but I can’t get through the mental block. Obviously, this isn’t great for my body which is on Rybelsus and metformin, and I love my job, but it is high stress.

I did search this reddit for posts about food aversion, and while I found a chunk of us going through some similar situations, I wanted to see if anyone was having my specific issues and how they’ve managed it? My primary care has a nutritionist, but she isn’t very helpful. Is this a situation for a nutritionist that specializes in eating disorders?

Just wanted to say that I’m in therapy, called a psychiatrist (looking into ADHD), and have an appointment with my endo in a few weeks. I know I need a medical professional, but just wanted to ask!

1n9fo4v,denotsmai83,New Caregiver Seeking Advice,"My father in law recently moved in with my wife and me. He’s a Type 2 whose previous caregiver (his wife) just wasn’t disciplined enough to help him, so his diabetes has been essentially unmanaged for a few years at least. He was hospitalized with diabetic ketoacidosis in December, which served as a brief wake up call. They put a CGM on him, but he ripped it off after a couple days and no one made him put it back on. His levels haven’t been tested since. When we got him a few days ago, we started testing the old fashioned way, and he was in the high 200’s. He has some cognitive effects from years of leaving his levels unchecked. It’s not severe, but it’s not mild either. 

We have some limited experience with the concepts of caring for a diabetic because my wife had gestational diabetes when she was pregnant. I know they aren’t the same, but the concepts of what one can and cannot eat seem pretty similar from what I’ve read so far. We immediately started a more structured food plan (he’s a notorious daylong snacker who rarely ate real meals), and while he’s still running high (mid 200s fasting, between 185-220 for most other readings), we feel like we’re making progress since this is the first time his levels haven’t even been checked, much less managed. 

That said, the biggest challenge we are running into is that he is an EXTREMELY picky eater. I can count the number of non-starchy vegetables he will eat on one hand, and there are literally two fruits (apples and cantaloupe).

Then I unexpectedly had to have open heart surgery, and because of the Glyxambi, I had complications and nearly died. So my doctor switched me to insulin. I take the fast acting insulin three times a day and the slow acting insulin once a day. I'm doing well on the insulin. I just hate doing the shots. They don't really hurt much, but I get bruises wherever I am give them to myself. I mostly use my stomach because it's not seen. And with four shots a day, my stomach is just covered in bruises.

So my question, any obese, diabetes T2 out there with any experiences with Ozempic, Wegovy, or Mounjaro? My goal is to lose weight through food, exercise and also get my A1C down. I do have a cardiovascular medication I use that could help me get on Wegovy I believe as my insurance has said but I would have to go through PA process! Just trying to figure this all out!

1kgvcdr,malibubabe28,Trying to understand why hypoglycaemia is occurring,"I've been working hard on managing my T2 this year but have run into a bump in the road. I've done a lot of walking this month (1-3 hours a day). I try and walk after meals to help get my glucose down. In the last week or two I've been having hypoglycaemia episodes when I walk and feeling weak.

Pictured above is an example. I ate my dinner and had a tummy full of food. My glucose is above 8 so I set out on a walk. 20 mins into the walk my glucose crashes down to 3.6 mmol/L.

Has anyone else experienced this sort of thing, or have any insight?

I'm on metformin, Jardiance and Rybelsus.

Possible causes:
Too much exercise?
Adding GLP1 to my medication?
Recovery of insulin sensitivity due to weight loss (1 stone) leading to over medication?
Reactive hypoglycaemia to meal (meal had complex carbs but not excessive sugar)?

I just feel frustrated as I've been doing all the things I think i should be doing but struggling to walk a great distance without a crash.

Any tips welcomed.

1n27fu0,Complete_Artichoke60,Normal glucose levels,"Hi everyone.

I was diagnosed with type 2 in april. I got a call from the doctor after doing my yearly blood examination that I had diabetes. They would give me a call back when they made an appointment with the endocrino doctor.

Few minutes later I get a call that they made the appointment and that I can go to the hospital in 2 months time (the wait time for a specialist in Belgium is aprox 6-8 months.

30 min later another call. This time the hospital. The doctor wanted to see mee the very next day. The blood test showed my hbA1c was almost 12%.

After a few tests they told me I did not have to stay in the hospital but that I needed to start my medication the same day.

They put me on rybelsus and metformine.

So here we are today. I don’t need to monitor my sugar level all the time but because I have a fear of needles, I choose to pay for the Libre 2 out of my own pocket. I wear 1 sensor every month.

In the beginning, I used it to get to know my body. What does food do to my sugar levels? And Here is the thing. My blood levels have never gone above 140-150 after a meal. During the day it starts at around 80-100 and after a meal it almost never exceeds 130. This is after Eating anything. It could be a pizza, french Fries, Rice, potatoes, …

The only thing that could make my sugar level explode are things like cookies. But I don’t eat that anyways. After reading a lot of stories I wonder if this is normal? My last hbA1c test came back 6,7%.

Before you ask, I don’t eat unhealthy every day, but I do get take out once a week. I also know that for my own health I should drink more water and eat more veggies, but I only like tomatoes, onions and salad 🥲

1bqhrno,Wonderful_Freedom70,DIABETES meds increase a1c?,"Has anyone experienced their Diabetes meds (oral or injected) making their a1c worse? 

I was diagnosed in 2016 and my doctors tried diet, exercise and eventually meds as a way to treat my t2. My endocrinologist has put me on all the regular meds: metformin, jardiance, rybelsus, trulicity, Amaryl.  I walk about 3 miles a day at work, and I follow ADA carb guidelines and I get my 5 a day of veggies, etc. My doctors agree to try rybelsus in late 2020 and I take it as directed, getting up to the top dose available.

The ONLY change to my regimen was this drug. My a1c went from 7.6 to 9.1. In 5.5 months. I also lost 20 lbs. But I didn't change my clothing size at all.... 20 lbs on my frame, my clothing should be falling off.
My endocrinologist had no idea why my diabetes got worse. Like that's not just a little. A lot worse. 

-

Has this happened to anyone else? 
I am beginning to see my diabetes journey is so atypical, as nearly everything I have taken does nothing, or makes my diabetes worse (or makes me so sick I can't continue past a month). My educated guess is all of my 30 lbs of med based weight loss was probably mostly muscle.

Has anyone experienced their Diabetes meds (oral or injected) making their a1c worse? 

I was diagnosed in 2016 and my doctors tried diet, exercise and eventually meds as a way to treat my t2. My endocrinologist has put me on all the regular meds: metformin, jardiance, rybelsus, trulicity, Amaryl.  I walk about 3 miles a day at work, and I follow ADA carb guidelines and I get my 5 a day of veggies, etc. My doctors agree to try rybelsus in late 2020 and I take it as directed, getting up to the top dose available.

The ONLY change to my regimen was this drug. My a1c went from 7.6 to 9.1. In 5.5 months. I also lost 20 lbs. But I didn't change my clothing size at all.... 20 lbs on my frame, my clothing should be falling off.
My endocrinologist had no idea why my diabetes got worse. Like that's not just a little. A lot worse.

1j67j7k,LadyCremeBrulee,Almost fainted at work and had...hives??,"As the title shows. I almost fainted at work because I had low blood sugar. I was dizzy, had spotty vision. The kind with bright colors that you could barely see what was in front of you. I was alsp very clammy too. After two Japanese jelly pouches and a chocolate muscle milk I was OK. 

But what's throwing me off about all of this is I was super itchy and was having hives. Like raised skin bumps kind that itched super bad and made my skin feel like it was on fire after scratching. I thought I was having an allergic reaction to something. I had the itchy hives before but instead of feeling like a I was passing out, dizzy and spotty vision, my fingers and toes swelled up which made me think I had developed a food allergy. 

Why did that happen? I'm so confused by this. I didn't know that was a thing that could happen or even be related to sugar blood dropping or rising. 

I'm okay now, I still have some of the itches on my thighs but im home safe. 

For any other details, I do take meds. I do struggle to remember to take all of them. Today, I didn't take my levothyroxine, rybelsus and farxiga this morning. I was running late to work.

I honestly didn't think my blood sugars were gonna drop so hard because I've known my levels to be on the higher side throughout the day. I think the other thing about not realizing my sugar levels were dropping was I was so itchy that I didn't look to see if my hands were shaking.

1clt1aw,Ok-Protection-4342,Management not needed???,"I was officially diagnosed in January as my a1c kept creeping up and slightly passed the official number. I had been prediabetic for the 4 years prior. I was on rybelsus for a year but the side effects were horrendous. I have a long family history of type 2, including my mom.

My dr was wanting to put me on mounjaro due to my a1c, sleep apnea, high blood pressure, etc. She said losing weight would help all of those issues. Once I received the diagnosis my insurance covered Mounjaro and I’m down 30 lb since January and my a1c is great, as well as blood pressure and sleep apnea. 

Here’s my question - I was sent to see a nurse who gave me the rundown on how to manage my diabetes, checking my blood sugar, what to eat, etc. Really put the fear of God in me (in a good way!) to get on track. But when I followed up with my PCM to ask about getting a meter prescribed she said I don’t need one, “unless you just like poking your finger.” Is this because my diabetes is managed with meds? I would still think I need to understand where I’m at each day and keep an eye on it. I feel like she was super dismissive and like it really isn’t a big deal, which is the total opposite of how the nurse was when I met with her.

\* My **hbA1c dropped from 10.6 to 4.8**  
\* My **weight** is **down 43.6 lbs (16.5%)**  
\* I've **lowered my triglycerides, cholesterol, LDL**  
\* I've **raised my HDL**.

I have **reversed my diabetic biomarkers (e.g. my lab work, I'm not claiming to be cured or reverse my diabetes) entirely** and **all biomarkers of metabolic disease**.

I'm not ready to go off my last medication yet, but I'm not afraid to try at some point. I have made significant lifestyle changes that are sustainable.

\*\*\*\* Read on if you have time!

Hi Everyone. I'm Erik. I have a story to tell and this story is a bit long and will become part of a blog that I'm developing where I'll host more information and updates in the future. I hope that elements of my journey will help some of you with yours.

**June 2006** \- I was in the best shape of my life. I was 32 and riding 200 miles a week on my road bike. I got down to 196 lbs, which was an amazing weight for my 6'2"" frame. I rode my bike from San Francisco to Los Angeles in an annual fundraising event called the AIDS Lifecycle.

**July 2009** \- I had a physical. I was told I had metabolic disease. No hbA1C was taken. This was the last time I saw a doctor until this year. I didn't really understand what this meant and didn't do much research. I was told I had fatty liver. I just really didn't understand the gravity of the situation. I was still fooled into believing it was all about the calories -- eat less, exercise more.

**Labs**:  
**Fasting** BG: 106  
**hbA1C**: Not measured  
**TriG/TC/LDL**: 152/224/155  
**WT**: Unknown -- probably > 235

I gained more weight over the years since then and my new setpoint was around 275lbs. I exchanged my size 32/34 jeans for 38/40. My highest recorded weight was around 286 in 2015. But I avoided scales like the plague, so who knows.

I went to the doctor at various times for various reasons -- I had a panic attack in 2009 and stopped drinking caffeine. I've always had palpitations and occasionally it would trigger a panic attack that would land me in the ER only for them to tell me I was fine. I was in the ER once and they tested my BG -- 173. Doctor assumed (didn't ask) that I had eaten breakfast (I hadn't eaten in 14 hours). But I knew what this meant. I eventually bought a glucose meter on my own. 212.. 250.. 273.. sometimes 170. But never lower.

I ignored what I knew to be true. I would sometimes make an appointment with the doctor and then cancel it. I didn't want to be told I was diabetic. I just needed to eat less, exercise more. I was a glutton. It was my fault. I got into shape. I can get myself out of it by not being a fat bastard. We all see and hear this on the news -- everywhere. It's what we're all told.

I don't eat sweets -- why am I like this? Yes I probably eat too much. I should just eat less because it's all about the calories, right? That's what society tells us. Eat less, exercise more. Simple!

**February 2022** \-- I developed appendicitis. At the hospital, BG was 273. I hadn't eaten for 3 days! I'm going to die. No one at the hospital said shit to me. But I knew what it meant. I had stopped testing my own BG 2 years earlier -- why? I knew what I had and what it meant. I didn't want to be on insulin (I thought everyone who was diabetic had to take insulin.. I was ignorant).

**August 11, 2022** \- I worked up the courage to finally go to the doctor. I didn't tell my husband. I had probably disappointed him by canceling doctors visits he would setup for me. Honestly we never spoke about health -- he's fluctuated up and down, but at 6'3"", he's always been reasonably fit. But I am going to die. I am going to lose my feet, my kidneys. I'm going to leave the person that I have loved dearly for 17 years. I'm not ready to go. I have to do this. I have to face this.

**Labs**:  
**Fasting** BG: 309  
**hbA1C**: 10.6  
**TriG/TC/LDL**: 163/224/155  
**WT**: 263.3lbs (Starting weight)

My doctor took a dump. Metformin was ordered that day (1G x daily). I had a follow up scheduled in a month, but we bumped that up to the following week.

**August 22, 2022** \- New doctor (I go to a teaching clinic and I think my R2 was over his head). She put me on 3mg Rybelsus. BG was coming down, but my fasting BG was still around 170 and I was spiking up to 270 if I ate the wrong thing. I had dusted off my old BG meter I bought in 2018 and was using that 4-6 times a day.

**WT**: 260.8 (-2.5 lbs / -1%)

**September 15, 2022** \- New doctor. BG was down to 140 but not lower. I was crapping myself all the time (metformin). Since the previous visit, I started researching Rybelsus and GLP-1RA drugs in general. I came across Mounjaro and really liked the idea of a once-weekly injection. I didn't like having to take Rybelsus, wait 30-60 minutes, take my next medication or get coffee, etc. And I wasn't seeing the results. So I asked my doctor about this and he put me on 5mg MJ and away I went on my journey with you guys! BTW, I had come in with exactly what I wanted in terms of dose and asked to start at 5mg.

**WT**: 256.6 (-6.7 lbs / -2.5%)

My weight and BG began dropping within 2 days. My fasting BG dropped from 140 to under 100.

**October 14, 2022** \- New doctor. Just a check in. All good.

**WT**: 232.8 (-30.5 lbs / -11.6%)

**November 30, 2022** \- Lab work

**BG**: 82  
**hbA1c**: 4.8  
**Tri/TC/LDL**: 73/179/118 (-55% / -20% / -37%)  
**WT**: 219.7 (-16.6% from SW)

14r5ugi,DiabeticPissingSyrup,Catastrophically bad idea. Wish me luck.,"I'm sure this post needs a warning that this is a BadIdea™ but I'm giving up on good ideas.

Since November Ozempic has been impossible to get hold of reliably in the UK. I know it's bad worldwide, but the NHS has told doctors that it's going to be AWOL for another 6-12 months since the only supplies coming in to the UK are getting snapped up by private clinics giving it to people who want to lose weight.

Rybelsus (or however it's spelt) has gone the same way. Victoza (which worked but had side effects for me and my shitty schedule) has now gone onto a protected list and they aren't allowed to put new patients on it.

My only options are a pill you need to take 20 minutes before food (good luck mixing that with ADHD), one that's pretty much guaranteed to give me thrush, one that will fuck me up if I don't drink enough (which I never do, hello ADHD), or insulin. Which I'm told will put weight on.

So, I've told the Dr to stuff it. If they can't do healthy treatments, I don't see why I should either.

Aside : my wife is seriously overweight and pre-diabetic, and has been put on a hospital diet that involved nothing but milk or fortisip, a vitamin supplement, and a salt supplement. She's lost significant weight on it and is now having solid food reintroduced, apparently as a keto style diet.

Back to the insanity: so... Fuck it. I'm going for intermittent fasting. One day of keto and two of a milk diet.

I need to upgrade my finger prick to a machine that monitors ketones too, but I'm going to give this a try.

I've already been told by drs that I ""just need to lose 15% to see things turn around"" but I'm already down from 154kg to low 120s which is 20% and just got a 72 HbA1C. Let's see what happens if I get to 100kg. That would give me a BMI of 28, so still ""overweight"" on this stupid bloody scale.

I guess this will either be a fun journey or a lesson in how not to treat diabetes. Let's see what happens.",16,32,2023-07-05T15:11:24,diabetes_t2,https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes_t2/comments/14r5ugi/catastrophically_bad_idea_wish_me_luck/,1.0,True,/r/diabetes_t2/comments/14r5ugi/catastrophically_bad_idea_wish_me_luck/,2025-10-27T19:13:39.315658,"Catastrophically bad idea.

14elafh,Library_IT_guy,I went in for my 6 month checkup today expecting the worst...,"And instead I had my lowest A1C reading ever - 5.0. 

I was diagnosed with an A1C of 13.7 in December 2021. 2022 was a bit of a rollercoaster as we tried different meds, and I tried various things like exercise and diet and low carb and restricted calorie and I was generally just miserable and depressed. My readings were around 7, then up to 10, then down to 6, and then today I hit 5. 

Thing is, I don't feel like I earned this at all. I eat less than I used to. I've lost 50 lbs and I'm still losing. But my diet is pretty poor. Fast food a few times a week which includes fries and breaded chicken. A small bowl of soup for lunch usually, which has probably 20-30 carbs in it. I've had cookies. I just took a week off work to binge a new game and I was the worst diabetic you can imagine during that week. I ate things like Doritos, a sub from a sub shop, a casserole filled with carbs, etc. I'm eating like half of what I used to because the meds I'm on cut my appetite down, but still... the quality of what I'm eating...

I'm just in shock. How can I be this low? Don't get me wrong - I'm ecstatic. My eye doc was super happy with my progress as well (had some vision problems), and I couldn't understand how his diagnosis was so good either, considering what I've been eating. 

I'm currently on 1000mg of Metformin, 4mg of Glimepiride, and and the standard dose of Rybelsus (which is a semaglutide and i think the key to my success), daily. I eat pretty much what I want, within reason, though the key is that I just don't want anywhere near as much as I used to when I eat. I go for a short walk in the evening but that's all I've been doing for exercise. 

I was dreading this appointment so much, but turns out I'm doing just fine.

I ate things like Doritos, a sub from a sub shop, a casserole filled with carbs, etc. I'm eating like half of what I used to because the meds I'm on cut my appetite down, but still... the quality of what I'm eating...

I'm just in shock. How can I be this low? Don't get me wrong - I'm ecstatic. My eye doc was super happy with my progress as well (had some vision problems), and I couldn't understand how his diagnosis was so good either, considering what I've been eating. 

I'm currently on 1000mg of Metformin, 4mg of Glimepiride, and and the standard dose of Rybelsus (which is a semaglutide and i think the key to my success), daily. I eat pretty much what I want, within reason, though the key is that I just don't want anywhere near as much as I used to when I eat. I go for a short walk in the evening but that's all I've been doing for exercise. 

I was dreading this appointment so much, but turns out I'm doing just fine.

17nsecf,Library_IT_guy,This disease is so weird sometimes. Ate carbs and had... a low?,"I don't normally eat breakfast and I often skip lunch too. Semaglutide just makes me not hungry, what can I say. Well as its Saturday, I decided to have some breakfast. I had fried potatoes, bacon, and eggs. I know, carbs bad, but my a1c was 5.0 and I never go over 180 after eating.

So lately I've been having bad diarrhea. It's not due to metformin - I dropped that a while back with my doctor's blessing. Most likely just IBD. Well that happened this morning so I took some Imodium. Got it out of my system. OK, think I'm good now, time to take a shower and get on with my day. As I'm drying off I get shaky, feel weak, and I can feel a low coming on. 

Now I just ate freaking potatoes. Surely not, right? But I checked... and I was at 46 bg level. I've hit 50 before but 46...   SHEESH. 40s is danger zone. Double checked to make sure... same reading. Oddly I still don't feel hungry. I mean I just ate like an hour or two ago. 

So I had a chocolate bar. I'm good now, sitting st 80. Have to go buy more emergency carbs because that was my last one. It's just crazy to me that this happened.

162eybn,kchamplin,What has taking insulin been like?,"I was diagnosed with type 2 about 12 years ago. I'm a skinny diabetic and have dealt with my condition by eating low carb, but I have continued to lose weight (I'm 5'10"" and I used to weight somewhere between 120-130, I now fluctuated between 114-116) and after wearing a continuous glucose monitor for a month or two it seems like my numbers spend most of the day in the 200-250 range.  At the last appointment with my endo he said something like ""You want to avoid insulin for as long as possible, correct?"" to which I said yes. So he prescribed Rybelsus, which I'm not taking because of my concern about losing more weight (it has a tendency to suppress one's appetite).

The last appointment I had with my endo was a tele-medicine appointment, and because he probably has an old laptop or something I couldn't hear him at all (won't do that again, he wasn't able to fix the sound issue after raising it with him), I couldn't ask questions, I didn't understand everything he said, and he didn't see me to emphasize how skinny I am.  (In his defense he had called my cellphone and had suggested I call him if I had any questions. I should have called him, but just didn't feel comfortable doint that.)

My impression is my endo thinks insulin is probably worth trying and so I've been mentally preparing myself to start given that 1) it will likely help me gain weight, and 2) it will probably bring my numbers down, 3) I will hopefully be able to eat with a bit more variety.

From what I've read, and based on past conversations with my primary doctor, he's likely to start me on a daily longer-lasting insulin. But I've also read that the most effective treatment will require fast-acting insulin required for meals, especially if I'm eating carbs occasionally.  (For what it's worth I've asked to be tested for Type1.5/LADA and I don't appear to have it.)

For those who treat their Type 2 with insulin, especially those that use fast-acting insulin for their meals, 1) how difficult have you found it to adjust to using insulin in order to improve your numbers while not going hypo? 2) Do you find you must stick to similar meals in order to get more predictable behavior from your insulin doses?  3) Has taking insulin made you feel better or worse, given you more or less energy?

For a skinny person I actually do a lot of emotionally eating, so I've thought about going to therapy to try to treat that, and I could still try doing intermittent fasting/time-restricted eating which I've done some very light dabbling in and have seen some positive results, but it does put a downward pressure on one's weight.",6,14,2023-08-27T08:38:35,diabetes_t2,https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes_t2/comments/162eybn/what_has_taking_insulin_been_like/,0.88,True,/r/diabetes_t2/comments/162eybn/what_has_taking_insulin_been_like/,2025-10-27T19:13:58.427406,"What has taking insulin been like?

199rg08,edenflicka,[UK] High key fed up with my diabetic nurse.,"29F, 300lbs. 

Diagnosed: August 2021, 301lbs, hbA1c of 77mmol. Started metformin, empagliflozin, ozempic. 

Lost 40lbs. Lowest weight in a long while. 

Review: March 2022, hbA1c down to 34mmol, GP very pleased with my results. Recommended that I stay on all medication to continue improving. 

August 2022 we moved to a different county. 

Review: December 2022, numbers holding steady, weight not budging.

January 2023: Booked in for consult with diabetic nurse at new surgery. Asked to be put on Saxenda since that was what my previous GP had wanted to do before we moved.

Lost 40lbs. Lowest weight in a long while. 

Review: March 2022, hbA1c down to 34mmol, GP very pleased with my results. Recommended that I stay on all medication to continue improving. 

August 2022 we moved to a different county. 

Review: December 2022, numbers holding steady, weight not budging.

January 2023: Booked in for consult with diabetic nurse at new surgery. Asked to be put on Saxenda since that was what my previous GP had wanted to do before we moved.

165ova3,Shellseys,I’m really struggling,"Hello, I (32 F) was diagnosed type 2 last October. The first few months, it seemed it was controlled with metformin, diet and exercise. Then, my A1C shot up to 10.2. I was shocked, as I’d lost about 30 lbs and was barely overweight at that point. My primary added Rybelsus, and I’m on 7MG with 1000 mg of metformin. It seemed to help a little bit, though my fasting sugars steadily became out of control. Now, I’m a normal weight, and I can barely have ANY carbohydrate at all, even when I pair it with a protein. My fasting sugars are over 200 (today, it was 309) my doctor doesn’t even seem concerned, and added Glimpirade 4MG to take with the Rybelsus and metformin. I feel so defeated. When I was first diagnosed, I decided to try my best to come off the medication. I went to a dietitian, and I changed everything, losing the 50 lbs I needed to lose to be a healthy weight. But the changes don’t seem to have ultimately mattered, because I can’t control my sugar, and I said enough and asked for an endocrinologist referral. My appointment isn’t until September 25th, and I’m desperately trying to lower my sugars until then, and I’m hoping being on 3 medications will take my sugars out of the 300’s. I’ve talked to a few nurses I know, and they told me about LADA diabetes. I seem to fit, but it’s like the more time that passes, the more control I lose and the more medication I need. I haven’t even been diabetic for a full year! 

I suppose I wanted to know if anyone else has had a similar experience? Thank you for reading! <3

UPDATE: My endocrinologist tested me for Type 1 diabetes. My GAD was over 250, and I tested positive for other antibodies associated with Type 1. I’ve been re-diagnosed as late onset Type 1.

1avr86p,Donna_Noble_is_saved,Ate carbs and was fine - already in good numbers so soon after diagnosis?,"Hi, I’m new here. I (47F)was diagnosed with T2 early December readings at 12 mmo/l and have been working really hard to cut down on sugars and excess carbs, focusing on fish, veggies, chicken etc. With the odd bit of wholemeal bread, pasta etc (every few days). I’ve dropped 11 kilos (around 24lbs I think, a long way to go still)  and my glucose readings are pretty stable, between 5.7 and 6.0 mmo/l usually (I test first thing, before evening meal and two hours after first bite). I take Metformin 500 morning and night and 7mg Rybelsus. 

Tonight I came home from work and my husband had made dinner for the rest of the family - Swedish meatballs, mashed potatoes and “gräddsås” (kind of a creamy gravy thing - Swedish). I was going to have a few meatballs with veg but I really fancied the mash. So I had maybe 3 heaped tablespoons of mash, 6 meatballs and some sugar snap peas, followed by a few spoonfuls of flavored quark (0.2% sugar) Two hours later my glucose reads at 5.7, the same as it was before dinner.  How??? Surely it should have spiked with the carbs? Usually I see post dinner readings around 6.5- 7.5/8 but this seemed perfect! Am I really that in control already that I can eat potatoes?  

I feel very confused. I  trying my hardest to take this disease seriously after years of putting off dieting and getting healthy, but it almost seems too easy to stray off plan if there are no consequences…and given that I’ve sabotaged every diet I’ve been in before I’m worried with results like these I’ll do it again.

After a month I stopped.  But in the end, it seems to me I should increase my Metformin.  I am 67 years old, exercise a lot, eat fairly well, and I am wondering if bumping it up to 1000mg or more would make a big dent in my numbers.  I am tired of constant low carb.

1064941,Library_IT_guy,I'm in shock. Fasting bg of 300 last year. My highest during the day is now 140.,"It was a long year for me and it sucked. Diagnosed last November with fasting bg of 300. I ended my fast with a bowl of jambalaya and skyrocketted to 450 and had a trip to the ER. Getting used to 1500mg of metformin was awful. Glimepiride is a miracle drug - zero side effects, absolutely works. Gabapentin may have saved my life. I don't know how much longer I could have lived with neuropathy. 

All of that plus diet changes and daily walks got me to 6.5 a1c, down from 13. Then I started eating poorly again and shot back up to 10. Glimepiride increased and started on Rybelsus. First few weeks of Rybelsus was as bad, maybe worse than first month of metformin, but it's getting better. I'm near the end of the  4mg period and I'll go to a higher dose soon. 

But it's working. I took my bg level last night 2 hours after eating, and I was only at 100. I'm still in shock. 130 this morning, when I tend to be the worst. I'm starting to realize, I CAN do this. And I don't have to be miserable. I can still have some carbs. I can eat chili with some beans in it. I can have that slice of cornbread. Just not as much as I used to eat. And with being on Rybelsus... I don't want more! My stomach no longer feels like a bottomless pit. I have a normal person sized serving and I'm full! The thought of eating more is repulsive. Is this how normal people feel?! All of my life, I've noticed others around me being satisfied when eating less. Even as a young child, I remember asking for seconds regularly when my cousins and friends did not want more. People would say I just liked eating more than other kids. I just had a bigger stomach. No. My stomach just lacked the off switch others had. 

This has been kind of a ramble. I guess I'm just saying that if you are struggling, if you're like I was for all of 2022, know that there is hope. It takes time to get the meds right. You'll need to make some lifestyle changes.

vfh9eu,Lost-Cc,T2 Freak?,"Greetings. I was diagnosed in 2017 after 5 years of undiagnosed IBS-D with an a1c of 6.8 after controlling with diet best to my abilities with non-FODMAP aggravating foods, and walking 4 miles every day at work, my diabetes has worsened continually. 

I have been on: metformin extended release, jardiance, rybelsus, Amaryl, trulicity and now I start Ozembic next week. I have had to stop many of these meds and try another due to the side effects of diarrhea or nausea, or limb numbness being so severe. Zofran does work for nausea, but not enough for me to function daily.

Not one of these meds has lowered my a1c. Rybelsus and trulicity did decrease my hunger, and I lost weight without trying, but the glycogen/ insulin output didn't seem to do jack or shit. During the 6 months of rybelsus I lost 20 lbs, but my a1c went from 7.6 to 9.1. My a1c is now 9.5.
My comprehensive blood, liver and kidney tests are always within normal ranges, every 6 months. My thyroid with t3 t4 is normal, cortisol was just checked and that's normal too. My diet and exercise have not changed. The only increased stress would be working during the pandemic in my lab job with no big breaks of rest. I work 40 hrs a week and I live alone, this has also been constant for 5 years.

1ogz8qj,InstanceSure4186,"2 Years on Ozempic — Strict, Disciplined, and Still Stuck at the Same Weight. Scared to Stop Because the Food Noise Comes Back.","Hey everyone,

I’ve been on Ozempic for almost 2 years, now on Wegovy 2.4 mg, and I’m honestly at a loss. I’ve been trying to lose weight for 3 years straight and despite doing everything right, the scale hasn’t really moved.

I also take Metformin 500 mg, blood pressure meds, cholesterol meds, and Vyvanse 10 mg.

About 3 weeks ago I started doing OMAD (One Meal A Day) and have stuck to it almost perfectly (just one 16:8 day). Before OMAD, I wasn’t a big eater either — I usually skipped breakfast and only ate lunch and dinner. I don’t drink any calorie beverages either, other than alcohol once a week.

Here’s what I’ve been doing consistently: High-protein, low-carb meals Calorie intake under 1,800/day Lifting 2–3x a week Walking/golf daily 2–3L of water + electrolytes 7+ hours of sleep with CPAP (sleep apnea managed)

Despite all that — I started at 273 lbs, dropped to 267 lbs the first week of OMAD, and now I’m right back at 273 lbs again. It’s like my body just refuses to let go of weight no matter how much I dial in my diet or exercise.

The most frustrating part? I actually feel healthier — my resting heart rate is down, energy is better, and I don’t feel sluggish anymore. But seeing zero movement on the scale after years of trying is disheartening.

And honestly, I’m terrified to stop Ozempic. The food noise — that constant mental chatter around food — was brutal before I started. It’s the one thing Ozempic completely silenced, and I’m scared it would all come back if I stopped.

Has anyone else hit this kind of long-term plateau where everything looks perfect on paper but your body just won’t budge? What finally worked for you — if anything? Did anyone switch medications or tweak something that finally moved the needle?

⸻

1oh2ldn,anxietygrrrrl,Hypoglycemia & neuroglycopenia while on OZ?,"So, i’ve been on and off of Ozempic for like over a year

This last time I was off of it for two or three weeks because of insurance issues

I just took my dose Tuesday, 0.25

I started having these strong reactions whenever my blood sugar would start to fall

The reaction was to the blood sugar falling, not the number itself

For example, I would go from 130 all the way down to 80 in the span of one hour

And I’m not gorging myself with empty sugar calories or high carbs or anything like that. 

I’ve kept a very strict food diary since restarting Ozempic.

The only time I have any “strong sugar” is when I have to treat a rapid fall that accompanies a bunch of really scary symptoms. 

Has anyone out there had anything like this after being on Ozempic?

I sent my doctor a message because today was just hell for me. 


The fast rate falling symptoms, especially the ones that are neuroglycopenia in nature : non painful pressure/congestion feeling in head that only goes away as blood sugar gets stabilized. 

Is honestly making me scared to drive, shower, get up and walk around, live a normal life.

I put in a phone call to my doctor and also sent a very urgent message through the messaging portal and I will be calling first thing tomorrow to follow up for an immediate appointment

But have any of you ever experienced “reactive hypoglycemia” while on Ozempic? 

Thank you 😊

For me, during the first month I was on 0.5 mg, and now I’m on 1.0 mg in my second month. But honestly, I don’t really feel a big difference in my appetite. I’m still quite the foodie — I still crave chips, and sometimes I even feel like cooking instant noodles late at night.

I keep reading that a lot of people lose interest in food or eat much less after a few weeks, but that doesn’t seem to be happening to me.

So far it’s been about a month and a half, and I’ve lost around 7 to 8 pounds, which I’m happy about. But I’m still wondering if it’s normal that my cravings and appetite haven’t really gone down that much yet.

1og69kx,Flat-Sprinkles-2367,New food sensitivity after a year? Sweet Tea is now an enemy 🤢,"​Hey everyone,
​I've been on Ozempic for about a year now and it's been mostly great! good weight loss, side effects have been minimal and predictable, mostly just mild nausea/fullness when I overdo it.
​But recently, I've had a couple of really rough, and honestly, kind of bizarre reactions to food that I never had before on the medication.
​The biggest culprit, and the reason for this post, is sweet tea.
​I've had it occasionally over the last year without issue. However, I've now had two separate situations in the last week where I had sweet tea and within an hour or so, I started lurching/gagging/near-vomiting. It's that awful feeling where you can tell your stomach is just NOT having it. After I puked I was fine both times. 
​Has anyone else this far out (a year+ in) developed a new, intense sensitivity to a specific food or drink that you were fine with previously?
​It's weird that I'm only having this extreme reaction now. Is it possible that the delayed gastric emptying has slowly made certain foods intolerable over time, even if I was okay with them initially?
​Just wondering if I'm alone in this or if my body is just officially filing an injunction against sweet tea.

1oegb8t,Legitimate_Onion_270,1 pen left....not sure what to do.,"Welp.  I've now gained back 20 solid pounds in the nearly 2 months since i tapered myself off of OZ before a surgery I had last month.  Food noise is back. No ""i'm full"" shut-off switch, inflammation is back. Lipedema in my legs is out of control.  I tried to stick with what i was doing while on OZ (increased protein, water, smaller portions, etc - all of it), and have been having about as much success as i had before needing to go on OZ to begin with.   The scale is now laughing in my face.   My starting weight was 265 - i lost 55 pounds in about 2 1/2 years time, and it only took 2 months to gain nearly half of it back.  WTF.    

I'm staring at the one 8mg pen i have left in the fridge and I'm wondering if I should just go ahead & click dose to .25  and ride it out hoping to calm things down again and to get me through the holidays,  or if it's even worth it since I can't afford to pay out of pocket to continue?  I'm hearing a lot about microdosing and wondering what those dosages are and how that works.  I'm looking into the online med-spas and whatnot that are doctor-supervised, but I have to give up all kinds of information in order to get ""qualified"" so i haven't done that yet (and i don't want to get scammed and spammed).  Uuuuuugh!!!

I'm so stuck in my feelings about it all right now - and pissed off that my body just doesn't seem to know how to regulate it's own metabolism without needing a medication to do it. I'm pissed off that my insurance won't cover the one thing i finally found that actually HELPED ME DROP WEIGHT - it was just completely taken away as an option.  Metabolism disorders are just as important to a person's health as any other disorder or disease!  I just don't get why EVERYTHING has to come down to money.  Don't get me started on the healthcare in this country (U.S.).

1oeqcr2,Namakrot,Ozempic vs Mounjaro,"Im sure there are plenty of subs regarding this exact comparison. But for context, I have been using ozempic for about 2 years. My highest weight before using was 288lbs, and my lowest within a year on Ozempic was 243lbs. 

Like many others, I developed gallstones and had an operation to remove my gallbladder approximately 9 months into the weight loss. A few months after the surgery I went on a long awaiting Europe trip and decided to take a break from injecting for about 4 weeks. I ended up gaining around 12lbs but was determined to get back and lose the extra pounds. After this trip, I had multiple visits to the ER due to some excruciating pain around my belly button but doctors never seemed to find anything after checking all my vitals and doing regular scans. Until after the 5th visit i insisted for a CT scan. In the scan it showed that the pain was due to an umbilical hernia. So another operation was scheduled to fix that. I went through 2 operations in one year. These pains and operations made me skip injecting quite a lot, and I eventually started gaining weight again.

Fast forward to today, I have gained a little over 30lbs and Im sitting at around 277lbs. Its been incredibly hard to get back to the lowest weight I was when I first started. Im still using ozempic weekly (1mg) but for some reason its not having the same effect. Im not over eating, im not back to my regular bad habits of eating junk, but im also not necessarily watching what I eat to be fair. I go for my regular daily walks, and am quite active with my 5 year old niece. At the beginning of this journey the nausea was extreme which is what made me lose weight, but I dont feel nauseous now and actually get hungry even the day after my injection!

I’ve heard many great things about Mounjaro, and I have an appointment with my doctor this week to discuss our options. 

My question from Redditors is: 
Should I even bother trying Mounjaro or is my body just rejecting these GLP’s considering ozempic is no longer working for me? Has anyone tried ozempic and had no great results but was successful with Mounjaro? Im really considering Bariatric surgery at this point if nothing else works.

1ody1xq,Dafeebs,What’s a polite way to ask people not to comment on your weight?,"I’m nervous to post this as I’ve never talked about it openly before, but I need some advice. I’ve started on Ozempic recently and I’m beginning to lose weight, and people are starting to notice and comment on it. This makes me extremely uncomfortable. Some context: I (30F) have struggled with my weight and body image all my life. I was overweight throughout my childhood, and when I was about 16, my self-esteem was at an all-time low and I started starving myself. That soon turned into binging and purging and I was in a really bad place. I lost a lot of weight, my hair was falling out, my skin and nails were paper thin and I felt like I was going to pass out 90% of the time. And all everyone kept saying – friends, family, teachers – was how fantastic I looked. It made me feel awful because they weren’t complimenting me, they were complimenting my illness. Now, over a decade later, I’m losing weight in a healthy way, and I’m doing it for my own wellbeing rather than out of insecurity. But the problem is, when people tell me how ‘great’ I look now because I’ve lost weight, it takes me straight back to that dark place I was in. It makes me think that if they’re noticing my body has changed, they must have been looking at my body before and judging it. I know people think they’re being nice, and they get confused when I react by getting flustered and uncomfortable. I don’t want to be rude to them, I just need a nice way of saying it’s none of their business and I don’t want to talk about it. I thought this would be a good place to ask – has anyone else had a similar experience, and if so, do you have any advice for what I could say to them?",43,131,2025-10-23T14:14:28,Ozempic,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ozempic/comments/1ody1xq/whats_a_polite_way_to_ask_people_not_to_comment/,0.84,True,/r/Ozempic/comments/1ody1xq/whats_a_polite_way_to_ask_people_not_to_comment/,2025-10-27T19:16:17.186686,"What’s a polite way to ask people not to comment on your weight?

I know people think they’re being nice, and they get confused when I react by getting flustered and uncomfortable. I don’t want to be rude to them, I just need a nice way of saying it’s none of their business and I don’t want to talk about it. I thought this would be a good place to ask – has anyone else had a similar experience, and if so, do you have any advice for what I could say to them?",polite way ask people comment weight nervous post never talk openly need advice start ozempic recently begin lose weight people start notice comment make extremely uncomfortable context struggle weight body image life overweight throughout childhood self esteem time low start starve soon turn binging purging really bad place lose lot weight hair fall skin nail paper thin feel like pass time everyone keep say friend family teacher fantastic look make feel awful compliment compliment illness decade later lose weight healthy way wellbeing rather insecurity problem people tell great look lose weight take straight back dark place make think notice body change must look body judge know people think nice get confuse react get fluster uncomfortable want rude need nice way say none business want talk think would good place ask anyone else similar experience advice could say,"['polite', 'way', 'ask', 'people', 'comment', 'weight', 'nervous', 'post', 'never', 'talk', 'openly', 'need', 'advice', 'start', 'ozempic', 'recently', 'begin', 'lose', 'weight', 'people', 'start', 'notice', 'comment', 'make', 'extremely', 'uncomfortable', 'context', 'struggle', 'weight', 'body', 'image', 'life', 'overweight', 'throughout', 'childhood', 'self', 'esteem', 'time', 'low', 'start', 'starve', 'soon', 'turn', 'binging', 'purging', 'really', 'bad', 'place', 'lose', 'lot', 'weight', 'hair', 'fall', 'skin', 'nail', 'paper', 'thin', 'feel', 'like', 'pass', 'time', 'everyone', 'keep', 'say', 'friend', 'family', 'teacher', 'fantastic', 'look', 'make', 'feel', 'awful', 'compliment', 'compliment', 'illness', 'decade', 'later', 'lose', 'weight', 'healthy', 'way', 'wellbeing', 'rather', 'insecurity', 'problem', 'people', 'tell', 'great', 'look', 'lose', 'weight', 'take', 'straight', 'back', 'dark', 'place', 'make', 'think', 'notice', 'body', 'change', 'must', 'look', 'body', 'judge', 'know', 'people', 'think', 'nice', 'get', 'confuse', 'react', 'get', 'fluster', 'uncomfortable', 'want', 'rude', 'need', 'nice', 'way', 'say', 'none', 'business', 'want', 'talk', 'think', 'would', 'good', 'place', 'ask', 'anyone', 'else', 'similar', 'experience', 'advice', 'could', 'say']",137,post,1ody1xq

1oe0rep,ttc902,Upper stomach pain,Last night my husband and I went on a date night. We had Chinese food. I ate very little because I knew we were going somewhere for dessert and I didn’t want to overdo it. I felt fine after I ate - we played at the casino for a bit then walked 15 minutes to do a dessert place. We shared an ice cream crepe. Again I didn’t much. When we were leaving the restaurant I got the absolute worst pain in my upper stomach - right below my sternum. I literally felt like it hurt to take a deep breath. It last maybe 5 mins - I could barely walk. Then it went away 🤷🏻‍♀️. I’m only taking 0.5mg and been on this dose for about 6 weeks. Has anyone experienced this before? I’m wondering if it may not even be related to the ozempic.

1od8lf9,Saffehish,70 lbs down.,"Imagine. I began this year at 305 lbs. In March, I went to a cardiologist appointment because I was having chest pain. I could barely walk up a flight of stairs at that point. 
I was super lazy, unmotivated, depressed, my diabetes was completely out of control, and I was diagnosed with PCOS and only having 2-3 periods a year. 

My doctor suggested I try Ozempic, and once my insurance kicked in, I started taking it. Instantly, all of that constant food noise was removed. All of the obsessions, counting down the minutes until my next meal, seeing food and salivating over it, thinking of restaurants nearby and planning meals any time someone mentioned meeting up anywhere.. it was all gone. The food obsession that I’ve had since I was a child - instantly removed. I never knew that it wasn’t normal to think about and obsess about food 24/7, because that’s all I had ever known. 

From there I began eating normally. Smaller portions, tracking and counting calories, began doing HIIT cardio fitness workouts on YouTube in my living room,  and then began walking and hiking more (on flat ground) before deciding that I was going to tackle a whole entire 6,000 foot mountain - Mount Washington. And I did it. Then I tackled 3,000 foot Mount Sutton, and now I already can’t wait to get on my next mountain (and challenge!), and now I am down 70 lbs. 

My periods have returned monthly, my sugar is completely under control, the depression and unmotivation are completely gone. I no longer feel sick every day, or like I hate myself, or as if I am simply surviving through life - but I feel proud of myself and like I am actually LIVING life now. 

Through both hard work and ozempic, I’ve managed to turn my life around this year. My only regret is not doing this sooner, accepting I had a food addiction sooner and getting help for it. Imagine where/who I could have been today? I won’t dwell on that though, because I’ll get there.

*Injection Site: Abdomen

*Weight: 206.6lbs

Hey everyone, I’m new here and just took my first injection and I barely felt it which is a bonus. I’m using it for weight loss and some other benefits my doctor advised me about. I’m located in Canada and was able to use Telehealth services to speak to a doctor for free, then I was referred for bloodwork which I paid $30 for so I didn’t have to wait, then the same Telehealth doctor prescribed it for me. Somehow it got covered by my insurance which I wasn’t expecting because it’s listed on their exclusions, but I’m not going to complain! I ended up paying just under $50 for the first month. The prices was super simple and so was the injection. 

For reference, I’m 5ft 1in, 206.6lbs which is the heaviest I’ve ever been, and I’m F 34. If anyone out there has experience losing weight on Ozempic as a short person please let me know! It can be harder for us in my experience since our TDEE is low to begin with. I was also recently diagnosed with ADHD so I decided maybe I need some help with my moderation and impulse control in order to lose the weight.

For reference, I’m 5ft 1in, 206.6lbs which is the heaviest I’ve ever been, and I’m F 34. If anyone out there has experience losing weight on Ozempic as a short person please let me know! It can be harder for us in my experience since our TDEE is low to begin with. I was also recently diagnosed with ADHD so I decided maybe I need some help with my moderation and impulse control in order to lose the weight.

Looking forward to seeing how this journey plays out, I’m tired of being overweight.",give shot injection dose injection site abdomen weight hey everyone new take first injection barely feel bonus use weight loss benefit doctor advise locate canada able use telehealth service speak doctor free refer bloodwork pay wait telehealth doctor prescribe somehow get cover insurance expect list exclusion complain end pay first price super simple injection reference heavy ever anyone experience lose weight ozempic short person please let know hard experience since tdee low begin also recently diagnose adhd decide maybe need help moderation impulse control order lose weight look forward see journey play tired overweight,"['give', 'shot', 'injection', 'dose', 'injection', 'site', 'abdomen', 'weight', 'hey', 'everyone', 'new', 'take', 'first', 'injection', 'barely', 'feel', 'bonus', 'use', 'weight', 'loss', 'benefit', 'doctor', 'advise', 'locate', 'canada', 'able', 'use', 'telehealth', 'service', 'speak', 'doctor', 'free', 'refer', 'bloodwork', 'pay', 'wait', 'telehealth', 'doctor', 'prescribe', 'somehow', 'get', 'cover', 'insurance', 'expect', 'list', 'exclusion', 'complain', 'end', 'pay', 'first', 'price', 'super', 'simple', 'injection', 'reference', 'heavy', 'ever', 'anyone', 'experience', 'lose', 'weight', 'ozempic', 'short', 'person', 'please', 'let', 'know', 'hard', 'experience', 'since', 'tdee', 'low', 'begin', 'also', 'recently', 'diagnose', 'adhd', 'decide', 'maybe', 'need', 'help', 'moderation', 'impulse', 'control', 'order', 'lose', 'weight', 'look', 'forward', 'see', 'journey', 'play', 'tired', 'overweight']",94,post,1od5pfe

1od0x8r,bwcch,New to Ozempic,"Hi everyone!

I'll try to make this short. By BMI, I'm morbidly obese. I have PCOS and probably a ton of other hormonal problems that have caused me to gain all of this weight and not be able to lose it / keep it off. I used to be so active, I worked out everyday for an hour at home, I danced, I worked a physically taxing job and still gained so, so much weight. Then I started eating like crap (and still do of course). I have tried everything from therapy, fasting, keto, WeightWatchers, HIIT, Jillian Michaels DVDs and diet plans, running, walking 5 miles everyday and I cannot. Lose. Weight. For the life of me!

I have a friend who started Mounjaro about 6 months ago and he's lost 50lbs already. I'm a little skeptical because that sounds insane to me given the situation but I think I'm ready to give this a shot. I'm out of ideas other than this. I feel like I've tried literally everything. One of the big things he mentioned is food noise and how it went away for him. I think this part I struggle with the most. I find I always want to snack on something or eat out of boredom. To try to counter this I make sure to snack on fruits/veggies but it's honestly embarassing that I ALWAYS just feel the need to be eating something.

I'll try to make this short. By BMI, I'm morbidly obese. I have PCOS and probably a ton of other hormonal problems that have caused me to gain all of this weight and not be able to lose it / keep it off. I used to be so active, I worked out everyday for an hour at home, I danced, I worked a physically taxing job and still gained so, so much weight. Then I started eating like crap (and still do of course). I have tried everything from therapy, fasting, keto, WeightWatchers, HIIT, Jillian Michaels DVDs and diet plans, running, walking 5 miles everyday and I cannot. Lose. Weight. For the life of me!

I have a friend who started Mounjaro about 6 months ago and he's lost 50lbs already. I'm a little skeptical because that sounds insane to me given the situation but I think I'm ready to give this a shot. I'm out of ideas other than this. I feel like I've tried literally everything. One of the big things he mentioned is food noise and how it went away for him. I think this part I struggle with the most. I find I always want to snack on something or eat out of boredom. To try to counter this I make sure to snack on fruits/veggies but it's honestly embarassing that I ALWAYS just feel the need to be eating something.

So, all of that being said, should I be worried about anything? Like the title says, I'm really new to this but I think this could be life changing for me, and I'm ready to make the effort again. Also, what do I tell my doctor when I finally get the guts to go? Thank y'all for reading this!

1od3796,jlvs1963,Anyone still having acid taste and mouth burning even a month after stopping Ozempic?,"Hi everyone,
I stopped Ozempic (semaglutide) about 30 days ago, but I’m still having acidic saliva, a metallic taste, and food doesn’t taste normal.

I had been on Ozempic for several months, reduced to 0.25 mg before stopping it because of this mouth burning and weird taste.
I’ve seen both my doctor and dentist, and they didn’t find any other cause.

I also tried Oniria, ashwagandha, and CBD for sleep, but I quit those weeks ago.
Now I’m taking Nexium 40 mg (esomeprazole) and starting a probiotic, hoping it will help restore the pH balance in my mouth.

Has anyone else experienced these symptoms after stopping Ozempic?

However i have some questions, i have been doing some research online and from what i can understand the most common side effects are nausea, vomiting and constipation which don't scare me to much. 

  
However there are also other side effects that have spooked me such as Pancreatitis and a allergic reaction. I have a 1mg pen, but should i perhaps start with an even lower dose then 0.25 since it's my first time and i'm not a diabetic, so this is straightly for weight loss. 

Here are some things i'm planning on doing to prepare, please let me know if there is something else i should know.

  
\-Take electrolytes before usage so i stay hydrated.

\-Eat as little as possible to avoid the vomiting and constipation.

  
I'm overall healthy and have no issues nor do i drink alcohol  and i'm just gonna be honest i'm already pretty skinny skinny( 21 years old, 53 kgs, 175 cm) but i have a hard time maintaining my weight.

  
The way i got ozempic was through my friend, he is obese and will start ozempic himself, but since i'm so curious how it feels to not feel ""Hunger"" i bought a pen from him.

  
Hopefully i don't get banned for admitting this, and yes i am aware it's bad and i have a disorder, that is why it's a one time thing.

1oh7cqs,Comfortable-Carry563,A love letter to 0 25 Wegovy,"I am extremely proud of myself ! It definitely hasn't been easy, but I have so much more energy now . I'm more confident. I'm also only taking 1 blood pressure medication ! Where as before ( just 4 weeks and 1 day ago ! ) , when I was 271.9, I had to take 3 different blood pressure medications a day, and now I only take 1 Blood Pressure Medication a day ! Bonus, all my labs look great, and my A1.C is now looking beautiful! 

So, I want to be completely transparent and honest. I was/am/always have been a HUGE BINGER/BINGE EATER !
It was so bad on/to me in numerous ways, including but not limited to , mentally,  spiritually,  emotionally,  and financially. As in while eating 1 meal, I would already be eagerly anticipating my next meal and/or snack. 

Especially at night, after I put my youngin to bed. I would just eat and eat and eat . To the point that my stomach would be in so much pain , and most nights I would throw up ( Not on purpose, definitely not bulimia, instead i would throw up because I had over stuffed my stomach because I obviously ate way too much ) even still I would continue to eat. I wouldn't eat out for real , actual hunger , but because food helped me feel better and mask/hide my emotions from everything I had gone through.  

I've noticed that I'm much more patient, empathetic, and compassionate, and I also give myself more grace , not just with my toddler but also with complete strangers! I smile all the time, and folks reciprocate with smiles and small talk !

 Most importantly ( at least, to me ) is that I'm a much better and healthier mother to my very strong-willed ,very loved, very much always wanted, very active, 3 year old toddler, lol . Now, I can actively play with him ! Including chasing him, hide and seek, running up and down, and all over playgrounds with him, going all over the zoo, etc . All things I couldn't hardly be active for more than 10 minutes ! 

 Honestly, I think several different things/lifestyle changes/ daily exercise/meal planning , loghing , charting, and tracking everything in MyNetDiary APP.  As well as meal prep/plus my Miraculous , Glorious, Wegovy - I did 0.25 MG for 4 weeks , 

The last 7-10 days on the 0.25 mg were the absolute hardest because the ""food noise "" started to creep back in , which also coincided with my ovulation. 

I did have a follow up with my PCP Dr , She's amazing and we discussed any/all side effects and i let her know that,  while yes I lost weight,  my "" food noise "" was coming back with a vengeance.  So I agreed to go up to the next dose. Which is 0.50 1X a week . So far, it's been nothing short of a miracle gor me ! I have another follow-up with my PCP Dr on 12/22/2025. And I'm determined to lose another at least 25-40lbs a month before I see her 

All combined are the reason why I'm happier, healthier and why I have more patience now as a woman and a SMBC ( SOLO MOTHER BY CHOICE) who in just 4 weeks 1 day has lost a total of 31.3 lbs !!! 

Started- 

September 27th, 2026, 271.9 lbs

Now-

10/26/2025-  240.3 lbs !!! 

That's  a total of 31.3 lbs in 4 weeks, 1 day !

As a huge added bonus , I'm not in as much pain , so that makes me feel tremendously better (even though it's only 31.3 lbs so far ) versus before when I was even 271.9 ! 

 I take my 3 year old on 30-minute walks 2X a day. I also take him to the park and actively play with him the entire time . While as before, I could only play a few minutes at the park with him before I had to sit down and typically sat on my phone for the rest of the time we were at the park. 

Also , even though I've lost 31.3 lbs , I don't see much of a change physically.  I'm still wearing the same clothes from 31.3 lbs ago. But , i physically feel BETTER and have more energy and more stamina!
 
I'm kinder to myself and try to remind myself that I didn't gain all this weight instantly or overnight, but it took years to get to 271.9 lbs  . So , down to 240.3 in just 4 weeks and 1 day or 29 days total ! Is AMAZING to me because I honestly never thought I would get here ! 

 I try to always have an Attitude of Gratitude because, Just like my toddler isn't going to just magically be able to control their emotions/outbursts and tantrums immediately! It takes patience,  compassion, empathy/understanding, and the ability to recognize that, unfortunately, sometimes life just isn't fair.  

For Example- 
While Betty Jo down the street eats ginormous , ungodly amounts of food ( at least when you see her ), and yet she still weighs the same as she did in high school! Ugh , that can be so triggering and devastating!  I caution you from these thoughts,  because all you have to do is remind yourself,  YOU are NOT HER ! YOU have zero clue what goes on behind closed doors ! Maybe she's depressed.  Maybe she's in an extremely abusive relationship,  or 
Maybe she has a medical condition and wishes she could GAIN weight! Maybe she's on drugs and burns through all the extra calories and then some.  Maybe she's bulimic? Maybe she had/has plastic surgery? Or on the other hand. Maybe she only eats OMAD, so it's a huge portion with a full day of calories, and you just happen to see her then . Maybe she's also on a GLP-1S. Regardless of her reasons, Please try and remind yourself that HER Journey,  HER life , Her Decision, HER LIFESTYLE, and HER CHOICE(S) and everything she chooses to consume or do is NONE of your business.  IT has NOTHING to do with you! REMEMBER IT IS NEVER OKAY TO COMMENT ON ANOTHER WOMAN'S BODY ! UNLESS/UNTILL , YOU'VE WALKED A MILE IN HER SHOES, YOU NEED TO MIND YOUR OWN BISCUITS AND YOUR LIFE WILL BE GRAVY ! 

STOP COMPARING YOURSELF/LIFE/JOURNEY to others ! We are all beautifully, uniquely ourselves 💖

COMPARISON IS THIEF OF JOY 💖

So, instead of sitting/laying around bemoaning my wasted life , I'm now ACTIVELY Participating IN MY LIFE ! I am no longer just a spectator in mine and my 3 year olds' lives ! Instead, I'm now an active and willing participant in mine, and my toddlers lives 💙

I do track and log over EVERYTHING,  including water in the MyNetDiary APP. I use the free version.  It's awesome, and I can also enter food(s) , meals, and/or drinks before I eat/drink them . That way, I'm able to stick to less than 1200 calories a day, and I can add or remove BEFORE consuming so that I don't go over ! It also has a bar code scanner that you can use ( also free) to easily see all nutrient facts, including serving size, etc .

You can also add steps per day and exercise, sleep,  medications, etc ! All free , that's why I'm not going to bother to pay 9$ a month when the free version works just as well !

Love Y'all from South Alabama.",4,4,2025-10-27T12:06:08,Semaglutide,https://www.reddit.com/r/Semaglutide/comments/1oh7cqs/a_love_letter_to_0_25_wegovy/,0.83,True,/r/Semaglutide/comments/1oh7cqs/a_love_letter_to_0_25_wegovy/,2025-10-27T19:18:08.402544,"A love letter to 0 25 Wegovy I am extremely proud of myself ! It definitely hasn't been easy, but I have so much more energy now . I'm more confident. I'm also only taking 1 blood pressure medication ! Where as before ( just 4 weeks and 1 day ago ! ) , when I was 271.9, I had to take 3 different blood pressure medications a day, and now I only take 1 Blood Pressure Medication a day ! Bonus, all my labs look great, and my A1.C is now looking beautiful! 

So, I want to be completely transparent and honest. I was/am/always have been a HUGE BINGER/BINGE EATER !
It was so bad on/to me in numerous ways, including but not limited to , mentally,  spiritually,  emotionally,  and financially. As in while eating 1 meal, I would already be eagerly anticipating my next meal and/or snack. 

Especially at night, after I put my youngin to bed. I would just eat and eat and eat . To the point that my stomach would be in so much pain , and most nights I would throw up ( Not on purpose, definitely not bulimia, instead i would throw up because I had over stuffed my stomach because I obviously ate way too much ) even still I would continue to eat. I wouldn't eat out for real , actual hunger , but because food helped me feel better and mask/hide my emotions from everything I had gone through.  

I've noticed that I'm much more patient, empathetic, and compassionate, and I also give myself more grace , not just with my toddler but also with complete strangers! I smile all the time, and folks reciprocate with smiles and small talk !

 Most importantly ( at least, to me ) is that I'm a much better and healthier mother to my very strong-willed ,very loved, very much always wanted, very active, 3 year old toddler, lol . Now, I can actively play with him ! Including chasing him, hide and seek, running up and down, and all over playgrounds with him, going all over the zoo, etc . All things I couldn't hardly be active for more than 10 minutes ! 

 Honestly, I think several different things/lifestyle changes/ daily exercise/meal planning , loghing , charting, and tracking everything in MyNetDiary APP.  As well as meal prep/plus my Miraculous , Glorious, Wegovy - I did 0.25 MG for 4 weeks , 

The last 7-10 days on the 0.25 mg were the absolute hardest because the ""food noise "" started to creep back in , which also coincided with my ovulation. 

I did have a follow up with my PCP Dr , She's amazing and we discussed any/all side effects and i let her know that,  while yes I lost weight,  my "" food noise "" was coming back with a vengeance.

1ohawan,adviceadultadhd,Is it too late to start tracking my weight loss?,"Hi guys, I’ve been on wegovy now for 12 weeks.

In the beginning I was very hesitant to use scales and track the weight loss as I was worried it would become almost compulsive and that I may “punish” myself if I say gained a kilo since the last weigh in. I instead used going down sizes in clothing to track.

Now that I have a healthier relationship with food with help from wegovy I want to look at starting to track the weight loss.  Do you think it’s too late to start? If not what are the best apps?

1oh9o5v,Different_Client3978,Struggling to control appetite —any tips?,"One of the biggest challenges I’ve faced with losing weight is controlling my appetite. I’m not talking about highly processed foods—more like high-calorie snacks such as nuts, dark chocolate, or lattes.

1og3h5g,Dangerous_Task_7690,1 Year on Sema,"28F

SW: 249.1lbs


CW: 194.2lbs 


Total lost on Sema: 54.9lbs


Started Semaglutide on August 16th 2024, and currently still taking 1.25mg. About 30lbs to my goal. I have lost in total 107lbs during my entire weight loss journey. Getting down to 248lbs on my own from 302. I got this ""mama"" shirt as a gift some years ago and I couldn't even get it on. It's a large. I have an Apron belly, so the shirt is tight across my hips because of my pooch but slowly it's getting more and more loose. I'm hoping I can come off the meds completely by next summer.



How I've done it:


Tracking calories/macros (1800-2000kcal), talk therapy, semaglutide, and going to the gym 3-4x a week lifting weights and minimal cardio. Lots of water, no extra supplements except collagen for my skin and joints. Diet is mostly high protein, nothing special. I indulge when I feel like it - just track it. My PMS cravings aren't really drowned out anymore and I feel ravenous during those times, despite the meds. Other than that, very few side effects. I get diarrhea usually the day after my shot but fine otherwise.

1ogiers,Cheese_is_my_fave,Wegovy shot every 2 weeks?,"Hello Reddit,

Looking for anyone who has moved to doing that shot every 2 weeks rather than every week?

For context - have been doing shots for 5 months and slow response but working. I'm prob only 7lb ish away from my top-end goal. 

Until last week I have had very minimal issues apart from occasional nausea etc. nothing outstanding.

Last Monday I woke up and had a very sore stomach, felt a bit diarrhea-ish. Went to work, had several explosions during the day then started vomiting about 3pm. Got home and vomited, I kid you not, every half hour until 6 am the next morning, was on the verge of heading to A&E when managed some electrolytes started working. I don't know if it was a sema reaction or unrelated but I have NEVER been that ill, it was horrific. 

Anyway, it made me want to quit Wegovy completely. Then I rethought and wondered about just giving my body a wee break and doing a shot each fortnight (in the UK so only one needle per shot, each week, 4 in a pack, so no option of tapering down). On Wegovy 1mg.

Biggest body changes - 

Decreased inflammation, slimmer face, love handles gone, back fat reduced significantly, better breathing, beginning to see ab definition after workouts.

Here’s what worked for me so far:

1. Regular Exercise - currently doing hot mat Pilates, peloton, lifting and yoga

2. Eating small portions - you cannot just go a full day without eating, even if your appetite is crushed you HAVE to at least try and eat a little bit throughout the day

3. Take plenty of before photos - at my highest weight I experienced so much BD that I hated taking photos so I only took one “before” video, but I wish I had taken more. It’s so helpful to have something to compare.

4. Planning around shot day - 24hrs after my shot I am super fatigued, so I don’t make plans the day after. I give myself permission to rest.

5. Fiber!!! - Make sure you find space in your diet for fiber, naturally if possible

6. Combine with food education - it’s really important to me not just to use a semaglutide to lose the weight but to also commit to having a healthier relationship with food, my nutritionist helps me learn more about my body and what is needs/why it needs it.

1og8dyv,LuciAffinity,Long term for PCOS?,"Has anyone with PCOS, who didn't start out significantly overweight, had long term improvement of PCOS symptoms with this treatment? I ask specifically in that way, because I know that loosing significant weight helps lower androgens and pcos symptoms. I am only about 10lbs overweight, could lose 20 and be okay. I have pcos and take metformin but I can only cope with 500mg/day without getting so sick I can't function. I used to take a much higher dose but I haven't been able to in over 2 years after taking a break from it. I can tell it does help with carb cravings because if I miss a few days I get crazy snacky. Such a low dose doesn't help with anything else though, still as hairy as a man, still battle cystic acne, still have increasing fatty liver and  not great cholesterol. I've been on metformin for probably 10 years. I am wondering if this could be more helpful with my PCOS. I take Slynd to help with periods, ovarian cycts and fibriods. I am 35 and have had a tubal ligation so I am perfectly happy with taking slynd continuously and not having a period. About a year and a half ago I was also prescribed Jardiance (another medication that is actually for diabetes). I am not diabetic, it was prescribed to support my heart after being diagnosed with early stage heart failure caused by one of my autoimmune disorders. It has been fine. Between multiple autoimmune disorders, pcos, heart failure, high blood pressure, and ADHD... its a lot of pills y'all! And the ADHD doesnt help me remember to take everything the way I should. This past week my Dr said that this treatment could help reduce the amount of pills I need. I haven't received it yet, waiting on insurance and the pharmacy to get everything in order. But the plan is, I can immediately stop taking the metformin because even the starting dose will probably be more beneficial for the actual health concerns related to pcos (liver, cholesterol, insulin resistance), then once I reach the maintenance level or whatnot, I can quit taking the Jardiance because though it works in a different way, studies show this is really beneficial for people with early heart failure. There is even a chance I could eventually stop my blood pressure medication. Oh, and it is also supposed to improve the outcome of chronic kidney issues, which I have. So anyways, as soon as it reaches my hands, I am excited to start it and work on ditching some daily pills. I can't seem to find much from women with pcos who have been on this without being overweight. I am wondering if even without dropping significant weight, if this could be beneficial for the other pcos symptoms that the low dose of metformin doesnt help (skin, hair, etc).

1of2vcc,gvvyndolyn,2 weeks on Wegovy and my hunger has never been that bad,"Hello everyone !  
First post on here but long time reader. I got to thank you guys for helping me take the leap from reading all your experiences :)

I started taking Wegovy 2 weeks + 2 days ago and I am crossing all my fingers for it to work on me !

I'm currently taking 0.25mg but I noticed something not nice happening: most of my appetite was suppressed thanks to ADHD medication (im on 40mg ritalin) but since I started taking Wegovy, my appetite is a bottomless pit. I need to eat 2x more than usual to feel slightly sated and all my binge eating episodes are back after being gone with ritalin.... So after just 2 weeks on Wegovy, I actually gained 2kgs (\~4.5lbs). 

Is this a normal thing? I'm dreading the medication will not work on me after experiencing this...   
Other than that, I felt no side effects at all, absolutely none, except maybe that it makes me irritated/short fused.

For the record: I (40f) am 103kgs (227lbs). I usually eat around 1300 calories a day with various nutrient sources, I'm caution about sugar and fat, I walk a lot (2 hours a day) and I have a little desk cycle for when I work to stay active. 

I also have PCOS and have been struggling with my weight all my life despite the fact that I didn't even eat that bad aside from the binges. I had a gastric band, tried metformin, drastic diets, nothing worked. All the doctors I went to told me I ""do not eat enough to weight that much"" so I'm terrified this drug won't work either. 

Any thoughts??",4,10,2025-10-24T22:17:56,Semaglutide,https://www.reddit.com/r/Semaglutide/comments/1of2vcc/2_weeks_on_wegovy_and_my_hunger_has_never_been/,0.76,True,/r/Semaglutide/comments/1of2vcc/2_weeks_on_wegovy_and_my_hunger_has_never_been/,2025-10-27T19:19:55.734370,"2 weeks on Wegovy and my hunger has never been that bad Hello everyone !

1oeznbh,Nanny_Ogg1000,Interesting self experiment with reducing SG levels or FAFO,"I'm down about 45 lbs in the last 6.5 months, losing about 1.5 lbs week. Of late the constipation associated with SG has gotten more pronounced and increasingly annoying, so last week I decided to reduce my SG injection to 1.0 from 1.2 mg, which has worked since the beginning. I didn't see much difference that week, maybe a bit of increased hunger crept in, so I got bolder last week and on Sunday reduced my shot to .7.

Well... let me tell you. It has been a journey since then. You think you know yourself, but you really don't. Over the last 5 days my daily average caloric intake has ramped up and up.  I track my calories and my daily intake has crept from 1700-1900 per day at 1.2 mg to 2200-2500 per day. And not through some ravenous blowout, just little eating decisions, made here and there thoughout the day.

I took stock last night and realized my desire for carbs has ramped up significantly, and I was still fighting food noise even with 2500 calories in for the day. My desire for carbs had gone through the roof. I did not really see or recognize the slow creep back of food noise until looking at my intake calories, it hit me in the face.

At the lower SG level my brain was quickly returning to it's wired-in impulsive, overeating habits. I decided to take my normal shot last night of 1.2,  and within an hour I could feel my appetite flattening back out. My take away is that (for me) food noise doesn't go away. My reduced intake and resulting weight loss is not in any way because of improved eating self discipline, it's all about the brain chemicals that control appetite.",7,1,2025-10-24T20:14:25,Semaglutide,https://www.reddit.com/r/Semaglutide/comments/1oeznbh/interesting_self_experiment_with_reducing_sg/,1.0,True,/r/Semaglutide/comments/1oeznbh/interesting_self_experiment_with_reducing_sg/,2025-10-27T19:19:59.191523,"Interesting self experiment with reducing SG levels or FAFO I'm down about 45 lbs in the last 6.5 months, losing about 1.5 lbs week.

1oeoom3,RoutineActivity9536,"Curious, who else had effects immediately? And how do you find it with anxiety?","So im wondering if purely placebo, or possibly an actual effect. 

I started 3 weeks ago (just took 4th dose at 0.25). I'm doing this with my mum. And I noticed effects almost immediately. My food noise is drastically reduced - though do notice it returning on the day or so before next dose. I've had increased heartburn but nothing major. 

My mum is much the same.

We've both lost well, me almost 4kg in 3 weeks. 

Are we just really lucky and respond to lower doses, or could this be placebo? Either way I'm absolutely happy - I'm just curious, also given the number of posts the sub get with people getting nothing at this low a dose. 

Also, today I had an interaction that would normally cause my anxiety to spike huge. But it didn't. I actually had several hrs when the issue didn't cross my mind (no hyper fixating!) and I was actually able to just let it go!

We've noticed a recent uptick in posts asking for ""unhinged"" or ""extreme"" weight loss advice. This subreddit exists as a space for healthy, sustainable weight loss discussions. Requests for ""unhinged"" advice clearly violate Rule 4 and undermine the purpose of our community.

We're fortunate to have a community that usually self-regulates these posts, and the majority of top responses tend to correct this mindset. As moderators, we prefer community-driven education rather than outright removal of posts. Unfortunately, there will always be a few bad actors willing to provide harmful advice in these threads.

Moving forward:

* Posts requesting ""unhinged"" or extreme advice will no longer be tolerated. These posts will be removed and you risk being banned from the subreddit.
* If you see a post like this, continue to educate and correct when appropriate, but also report the post so moderators can quickly handle it.

It's true that obesity can cause health problems in young people but we can't be giving advice to underage redditors for two main reasons:

*Growing bodies need to be nourished and it's dangerous to development to cut nutrients along with calories. Weight loss by teens should be under medical supervision. 

*We don't want to be responsible for creeps on the internet being able to identify teenagers with body image challenges! Please be careful how much personal info you give out and don't get involved with strangers in your inbox

If you are a teenager who wants to lose weight, you are welcome to read through the wealth of info on other people's posts. There are so many helpful people here who have had success losing weight in a healthy way. You can learn a lot and find resources, but also please see your doctor.

1ogy2qj,Far-Layer324,Reasons Why The Scales Go Up When You Think They Should Go Down...,"

1. Stress.  Your body can hold onto water when you are stressed.  And stress can come on suddenly.

2. Ovulation (Ladies). Your body can hold a stack of water and inflammation when you ovulate (for some women, more so than pre-menstruation)

3. Premenstruation (Ladies). Yep - you know this. Your body inflames and this definitely shows on the scales!  Even a week out!!

4. Exercise. If you've done more exercise than normal, or harder training than normal, your muscles are likely to be taking more water in for repair.  Plus they're a little swollen themselves.

5. Maybe you ate a big meal last night and it hasn't left your body yet. This is NOT FAT.

6.  Carbs. When you eat carbs (particularly processed carbs) your body automatically attaches water to it, causing an increase in bloating and weight on the scale.  It goes away once digested.

7. Inflammation (similar to stress). When your body is inflamed for any number of reasons (illness, injury, over-exertion) it will hold onto whatever it can to repair.  It's temporary (as long as the inflammation is temporary!)

All of these things have NOTHING to do with your actual body fat and muscle levels!! 

You did NOT gain 1-2KG of extra bodyfat over night (or in a week!)

1ogxiy0,stewpert5,Is Anyone Actually Enjoying Their Weight Loss Journey....because I am....,"....and apologies. I know for some people it's incredibly hard, or it's for reasons that would never slot into the 'enjoying' section.

I've been on my weight loss journey since June. Lost a fair amount of weight through calorie deficit, exercise and a weekly 24hr fast bla bla bla. I've also slipped up and eaten way to much or some days, and on once occasion I 'accidentally' dropped two packets of Haribo sweets down my throat. 

Right now I'm in a plateau which is mildly annoying - but I've really enjoyed it all. I guess the exercise is making me feel better etc etc. But I'm finding all these scientific facts out about me - my body (mainly my insides....) and just finding it fascinating.

1ohdbem,Hazard_Factory,Lost 10 lbs within a week and I have mixed feelings about it,"Began my weight loss journey a couple of weeks ago with my starting weight of 325. For some extra background I'm a 25 year old 6'2"" male. I want to add that I do not have diabetes or anything either. My first weigh in was last Monday and I'll be doing weekly weigh in's on that day going forward. This morning I weighed in at 315 and I checked a couple of times just to make sure it was accurate. Now throughout the last couple of weeks I have been going on daily walks and sprinkling in rides on my exercise bike and some minimal weight training with dumbbells that I have. Been in a calorie deficit every day since I started as well, but maybe a bit more than I should have. I usually find myself in the 1200-1800 calories per day range and I know I should probably be eating more to get to at least 2000, but it's hard for me to get down a lot of the low calorie food I've been eating without getting really full. I've mainly been eating meats (ground beef, steak, chicken, etc.) a mix of veggies and fruits, and a bit of bread as well. 

After the weigh in this morning obviously I felt pretty happy about it, but I'm also cautious that it may be happening too quick. Since I'm over the 300 lbs range, loose skin is going to be a real concern when I get closer and closer to my goal weight and correct me if I'm wrong, but if you lose weight too quickly doesn't that increase the amount of loose skin that may appear right away? I do want to add that I have been sick with a cold the last few days, but it hasn't really affected my daily routine as it has been. I'm aware that it could be a majority of water weight that I may be dropping as well, but still just want to make sure I'm doing things right and don't want to rush it to make things more sustainable.

1ohcvep,grieving-sinner,Weightloss journey update!,"Hello kind strangers of reddit! I am sure many of you will not read this, or maybe not care, but i would like to give a little update on my weightloss journey.

I would like to first give the story of how it started. Exactly 2 months ago i got on a scale and i saw i was 129.5kg. i remembered a talk i had with a close friend many years ago and I had said ""if i ever get close to or above 130kg, i will not continue that path and will stsrt to lose weight. 130kg is the line i am not eilling to pass""
And seing i was so close to the line i decided to start this journey of losing weight.

My goal is to reach around 95kg (I am 188cm- 6'2 tall) and. It has been quick, quicker than I have imagined, for now at least. 2 months ago exactly I was 129.5 kg, and after 2 months I got on that same scale and the number was 115.5 kg (14kg in 2 months!) and I am so happy! In around 11 days i got down another 2 kg btw.

How I did it is simple, I just started counting calories, i eat what I eant but i look to stay below some calorie limit.
Now this is somewhat easy, i do get hungry sometimes and I can't eat unless I go above my calorie goal, and sometimes that goal was not met, I've went above it once or twice in 2 months but I have also gone a lot below that so it is somewhat balanced in that regard. 

One thing that jas helped me in this journey is definitely getting my thyroid issues sorted, and i started seing a psychiatrist and have been prescribed antidepressants (I've struggled with anxiety and depression (Caused by PTSD) since i was 14, i am 21 now) and that has definitely helped me out too (I've been on them for a month now).
I have noticed that my appetite is significantly lower since I have started them, which I was surprised since most people do experience the opposite, and the lower appetite definitely has had an impact on this journey as well.

2 months ago I started with the goal of losing weight and now that goal has been somewhat revised, it is not about losing weight anymore, but it is also about getting better physically, emotionally and psychologically- that goal is slowly getting reached. 

I hope all of you have a blessed day, and know that whatever you are going through, you are not alone and my inbox is open if you just want to talk or whatever. 😊",1,1,2025-10-27T17:50:13,WeightLossAdvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/1ohcvep/weightloss_journey_update/,1.0,True,/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/1ohcvep/weightloss_journey_update/,2025-10-27T19:21:16.908084,"Weightloss journey update!

1oh8osx,Whos_Giggles,What's some good technique that helped you stay on course with your diet?,"Hi there, gotta a serious question that I'm wondering if and how others have dealt with this. So I weigh around 360lbs and my goal is 250lbs, I work in a warehouse so I'm all my feet all day and moving around, also want to hit the gym a couple times afterwards as well. I have a issue that my appetite is off and all messed up, in my usual days I rarely eat breakfast and lunch and throughout my day I don't drink as much water as I should, idk why I'm like this I'll get on a small schedule and go right back to an old habit and then when I get home I usually eat and eat and eat which doesn't help me. I've tried from time to time to snack throughout the day but it doesn't help that much too so I'm wondering what tips and tricks that if anyone did helped them out a lot .

1oh3n4w,carbonatedeggwater,I’ve gained weight to the point that I don’t recognize myself anymore,"I quit my ADHD meds abruptly recently.  And a few months before I quit them, I also took a month off.  During that first month off, I binge ate due to low dopamine and gained 10 lbs.  I was starting to lose that 10 lbs before I quit the meds for good.  After quitting, I spent the last 2.5 months binge eating (due to low dopamine) and gained another 10 lbs.  I weigh the most I’ve ever weighed right now.  I’m a few lbs away from having an overweight BMI.  I’ve never been overweight, at least not that I know of.  I’m inflamed.  I wish I controlled myself better, drank more water, and made sure I had access to more low cal snacks during my initial quit of the meds.  I don’t feel pretty.  I don’t look like myself.  And I know this isn’t healthy.  I can feel it.  I haven’t been working out as much.  I haven’t been going on daily walks outside.  I’m finally starting to get into a routine, clean my house daily, and stop bingeing.  So hopefully I’ll lose the weight over some time.  I’m not planning on doing any massive deficits, 1500-1700 at the lowest and increased exercise.  I don’t care if it takes a year to lose 20 lbs, as long as I stop gaining and start losing.  I want to do it the slow way so those habits stick and I don’t gain it back again.  I just wanted to make a post to say to myself that it starts here.  

Note:  for any who don’t know, when you first quit ADHD meds, your brain tries to adjust itself and lowers your dopamine by a lot.  Your dopamine rapidly gets decreased from what ur brain is used to.

1ogdger,Critical-Shirt2190,Nobody tells you that the best food memory you'll make isn't in 5 years—it's 20 minutes from now when you can finally fit into those jeans again.,"I'm serious. We spend so much time debating whether to eat the cake or skip it that we forget something crucial  the real satisfaction isn't in the taste. It's in the decision.

Here's what nobody warned me when I started losing weight. I thought I would be miserable  that I'd spend years fantasizing about pizza and donuts that I'd wake up every morning fighting this internal battle between healthy me and binge me.

Spoiler alert. that's not what happened.

What actually happened was weirder and way more powerful than I expected. About four months in I realized I wasn't craving the food anymore I was craving the person I was becoming. And that person. She didn't want to feel bloated after meals. She didn't want to hide in oversized clothes. She didn't want to spend her best years avoiding mirrors.

But here is  the plot twist that gets me every time I can still eat whatever I want. I just  don't really want to anymore. Not because I'm restricting myself or white knuckling through some diet.

It is because my brain finally caught up with reality. Food tasted amazing when I was using it to fill an emotional hole.

Now that I'm not doing that it turns out broccoli tastes pretty good actually. And that one slice of birthday cake  way more satisfying when it's actually special  not just another Tuesday.

The hardest part wasn't losing weight it was losing the excuse.

I did end up losing the weight and getting to the measurements I needed to reach, but then I got sort of stuck at 1200 daily, with occasional days where I'd eat far far more. And for a while that worked, but then I started to gain weight again - I did change up a few things, and tried to eat more protein and carbs, and tried to work my way back to maintenance cals, so I was eating about 1450-1500 cals, and originally I just figured it was water retention but for the past two months I've been steadily gaining, and I've gained about 4kg now, and I don't think it's muscle unfortunately. I am also now constantly bloated, have bad digestion, and am supposed to go back down again for modelling :( I know it's unfortunately not the healthiest situation, but also I will not be in this career for long since it's quite age-determined, so I do want to give myself the best chance. I am 168cm, female, and 22 years old. I used to have quite a fast metabolism when I was younger, but I figure I may have crashed it from being on a deficit for too long - but even from just adding 200-250 cals, I've been gaining weight rapidly. I am not sure that cutting it down again is really going to help, so I would love to know if anyone has any advice. I need to lose the 4kg again, but what would be the best way to do that?

1ogmvz7,Ok-Literature-7677,Current weight loss vs previous weight loss attempts,"I’m a child of a crash/trendy dieter. Atkins, Mediterranean, low carb, weight watchers. If it was a diet in the 90’s, my mom did it. And she drug me along with her. I did weight watchers on and off between the ages of 12-18, even going to meetings. We were eating frozen low calories meals because they were “healthier.” I would be so stressed about not having enough points left.  I would have a meltdown if my family decided to go out to eat and I was low on points. Once I was 15, I just tried to do it on my own because I was so worried about being bigger than everyone else, looking back at pictures, I was not fat, but I was curvy and more developed when most of the girls my age were not yet. 

I had such a bad relationship with food and how I viewed my body. When I moved out on my own, I was a binge eater. As an adult, I feel like I self sabotaged myself every time I tried to lose weight because I went in with a mindset that I was just going to be miserable eating foods that fit my calorie goal and then eventually give up. Based on previous efforts, I also know that I cannot have a scale in my house. I would weigh multiple times a day and stress about it. I was also pretty mentally unwell with undiagnosed anxiety that only got worse. 

I’m now in my 30’s. My mental health is significantly better. I started at 249lbs. I’ve been around this weight since having my last kid 6 years ago. A month in and I’m at 236.8lbs, my clothes are fitting better, I feel better. I spent about two weeks strictly counting calories in a tracker without really changing my diet to see what I was consuming. The next two weeks I started on calorie deficit and tracked everything, swapping out things I love for more calorie wise versions and eat smaller portions. I knew I was losing weight based on how my clothes started to fit better and I do a weigh in once a week or so when I go to my parents house. 

I still go out to eat, I just eat half of the meal or less and take the rest to go. I drink coffee with flavored creamer every morning. I don’t always stay at my calorie goal, sometimes I go over a few hundred calories. When I know I’m over, I don’t beat myself up about it and decide to binge the rest of the weekend like I would in the past. There is no “start again on Monday” anymore. If I go over one day, I just get back on track the next day. 

Not sure if this is helpful to anyone, but just wanted to share my experience as yo-yo dieter for over half of my life and as someone who LOVES good food. I’m learning to love my body the way it is now and as it changes and fix my relationship with food along the way.

1oh031m,another_npc_redditor,Am I destined to be fat for the rest of my life?,"I honestly don’t understand what I’m doing wrong anymore. I’ve been eating less, focusing on balanced, healthy meals, and going to the gym three times a week. I’ve stayed consistent for two months, but the scale just won’t move. It’s so discouraging.
About a week and a half ago, I broke down. I was so sad and frustrated that I ended up coping with food again, and I’ve been overeating ever since. Now I’ve gained weight, and it just makes me feel even worse. I feel like no matter what I do, nothing works. I’m so over it.

It’s not like I’m not trying. I walk regularly too, but I’m really limited in what I can do. I have a torn meniscus, so running or doing high-impact workouts is out of the question. I also have panic disorder, and intense cardio triggers my anxiety and panic attacks. It’s so dumb but it happens. I used to be an athlete, and now I feel like I’m trapped in my own body. I’m only 24, and I feel like a slave to it. Even though I want to push myself harder, my body and mind just won’t let me. And then there’s the PCOS. I know it makes everything even harder the insulin resistance, hormonal imbalances, slower metabolism, constant cravings… it all adds up. 

It honestly feels like my body is fighting against me every step of the way. Between my knee injury, my anxiety, and my PCOS, I feel trapped. I’m trying so hard, but I’m not seeing results. It’s exhausting physically and emotionally. I just wish I could see even a little progress, something to show that all my effort is paying off. Right now, I just feel stuck and defeated. 😞

I really need help some kind of solution or hope. I just want to feel like it’s still possible to beat the odds and finally feel good in my body again. 🥺

I’m currently around 5 stone down in my weight loss journey.
I’ve managed to lose this without hardcore dieting/fitness over 3 years but this year ive been a lot more strict with myself entering half marathon and due to do a hyrox in November, but I am still allowing a cheat weekend, chocolate most days etc etc

I recently went on a trip to Miami for 10 days and ate alot, i still trained 4 times when I was out there and walked about 20k steps a day, when i came back I weighed and it said I was now 15stone, really felt like it has set me back!!

I was 19stone (266/267lbs) I’m now down to around 14stone (197)lbs, I’m still training most days and I do expect to get back down to the 14 stone within a week or 2 as I know most of that will be water weight but where do I go from there when I do get back down to 14st

I’m using my fitness pal and trying to consume around 1800 calories a day and getting a lot of protein. Do i need to drop these calories or continue to where I’m at and just be patient?

1ogp3xn,PopularFish4605,Realizations during weight loss,"I'm a 27 year old female and 5'0 ft. I weighed 136 pounds. I was overweight for my height. I had been no more than 100 pounds, with my normal weight being 96 pounds. And I looked great, but you couldn't tell me back then that I looked great because my friends and family would constantly tell me that I was ""too skinny"". I wasn't too skinny, I was just skinnier than them. Now I am down to 118 pounds. You can see the weight loss progress in my face, legs, arms, and definitely the stomach. Last night I scared myself because I was rubbing my chest and felt my collarbones again for the first time in 9 years. I'm back in Size small already, and I don't feel the constant sensation that I'm carrying extra weight around all the time. 

I wanted to get down to 110-115 and maintain that weight. But after hearing my ""so-called friends"" negativity, I think I'm going to go back to 96-100 pounds. It only took me a month and a half to lose the 18 pounds I have so far. All I've done is run 1 mile every day, use a workout for women app, and do a calorie-deficit diet tailored to MY height. I stress MY height, because I am a petite woman. I can't eat 1800 or even 1,500 calories every day and lose weight like a 5'7 woman can. I would have either stayed at 131 or, even worse, GAINED more weight. It was the nitpicking on how much I wasn't eating from my friends in the beginning. Which I could understand at first. But eating at maintenance would not make me lose weight. That's the reality of that. Been there. Done that. Stayed fat. 

Then, when the actual physical reflection of my weight loss started, they really had at it. ""Oh you're going to lose your butt."" ""You look like a little 14-year-old girl. You're going to attract the wrong men for the wrong reasons."" And all the crap I remember them telling me for years, since high school and college came back to me, and I remembered what made me gain the weight in the first place. I can't explain it in words, but it's like they triggered memories in me that I had suppressed. Memories that had been trapped in the weight. And once the fat was gone, they could be released. 

Growing up, I was bullied for being short. I was bullied for being skinny. I was bullied for being different and introverted. Hell, I even got bullied for having a different dialect in my speech because both my parents are Irish immigrants from rural Ireland, so I spoke how they spoke for the longest time until starting school. Looking back on it now, I was the most interesting person. I had the most interesting childhood, parents, and life. I was so interesting and amazing and beautiful and original. I was something new. But you couldn't tell me that then. So I ate. I ate for comfort. I also ate to satisfy others. I ate to fit in and feel ""pretty"". 

Not listening to those people ever again, literally about anything and everything. Broken ties with 2 of them last month. Went to Wild Wing Cafe for a mutual friend's birthday. She hasn't seen me in over a year. She said I looked amazing, and she's happy I lost the weight because she was getting worried for me since diabetes and fatty liver disease run in her family. She's also always had a healthier weight than the other 2 within our social circle. I wish I had never lost contact with her like I did. I probably would've never gotten fat lol. 

One of the husbands of the friend I cut off said I looked ""good"". I guess her own husband is one of those ""wrong men"" lol. And I got hit on by the stage tech setting up for the band, who was pretty hot lmao. I've noticed that I truly have not been hit on in a long, long time. Like a very long time. I've always had a pretty face, but my weight gain surpassed it, and made my face look puffy at 131. Now people can see me again for who I am inside. And I won't let anyone take that from me again. 

Buying new clothes has been fun. I stopped posting on Facebook and Instagram about a year ago because I stopped wanting to share myself. I felt so ugly. Took forever to find a pose that I didn't feel or look puffy in. And my face shape had just changed so much. I've started posting again, and family members have commented on how great I look. I know they want to mention that I lost weight, but probably don't want to be rude or sound like an idiot because my family always nicked at me about being skinny. They nicked at me even worse when I got fat too, though lol. Needless to say, the majority of my family are in Ireland and I haven't been back to Ireland since I was 22. At that point, I was probably 131, and they were very blunt. Several of my female family members told me plain and simple, ""Stay out the kitchens"". I should have listened. I really should have listened. 

When I was overweight, if I got a message from a guy, it was always from an overweight guy or a guy I just wouldn't go for. But the reality of it is, they were in my league when I was overweight, and even they knew that. Now, I get messages from guys I would genuinely be proud to date. Attractive, handsome, hardworking, and ambitious men. I have a date planned soon, and I'm so excited. I haven't dated since I was 19 years old. And that ex-boyfriend is now married and has children, and has started a whole life. And I've just been fat. Oh my god. I cry as I type that part. But that has been my reality. I've just been sitting here this whole time. Hiding myself and only showing up for food.

I feel like I had died. I was dead all those years I was overweight. I didn't feel like I was alive. Being overweight killed me. I let the people who I trusted the most kill me. And the weapons were forks, self-hate and negative thoughts. But I'm back alive now, and they all can shit themselves.

Then, when the actual physical reflection of my weight loss started, they really had at it. ""Oh you're going to lose your butt."" ""You look like a little 14-year-old girl. You're going to attract the wrong men for the wrong reasons."" And all the crap I remember them telling me for years, since high school and college came back to me, and I remembered what made me gain the weight in the first place. I can't explain it in words, but it's like they triggered memories in me that I had suppressed. Memories that had been trapped in the weight. And once the fat was gone, they could be released. 

Growing up, I was bullied for being short. I was bullied for being skinny. I was bullied for being different and introverted. Hell, I even got bullied for having a different dialect in my speech because both my parents are Irish immigrants from rural Ireland, so I spoke how they spoke for the longest time until starting school. Looking back on it now, I was the most interesting person. I had the most interesting childhood, parents, and life. I was so interesting and amazing and beautiful and original. I was something new. But you couldn't tell me that then. So I ate. I ate for comfort. I also ate to satisfy others. I ate to fit in and feel ""pretty"". 

Not listening to those people ever again, literally about anything and everything. Broken ties with 2 of them last month. Went to Wild Wing Cafe for a mutual friend's birthday. She hasn't seen me in over a year. She said I looked amazing, and she's happy I lost the weight because she was getting worried for me since diabetes and fatty liver disease run in her family. She's also always had a healthier weight than the other 2 within our social circle. I wish I had never lost contact with her like I did. I probably would've never gotten fat lol. 

One of the husbands of the friend I cut off said I looked ""good"". I guess her own husband is one of those ""wrong men"" lol. And I got hit on by the stage tech setting up for the band, who was pretty hot lmao. I've noticed that I truly have not been hit on in a long, long time. Like a very long time. I've always had a pretty face, but my weight gain surpassed it, and made my face look puffy at 131. Now people can see me again for who I am inside. And I won't let anyone take that from me again. 

Buying new clothes has been fun. I stopped posting on Facebook and Instagram about a year ago because I stopped wanting to share myself. I felt so ugly. Took forever to find a pose that I didn't feel or look puffy in. And my face shape had just changed so much. I've started posting again, and family members have commented on how great I look. I know they want to mention that I lost weight, but probably don't want to be rude or sound like an idiot because my family always nicked at me about being skinny. They nicked at me even worse when I got fat too, though lol. Needless to say, the majority of my family are in Ireland and I haven't been back to Ireland since I was 22. At that point, I was probably 131, and they were very blunt. Several of my female family members told me plain and simple, ""Stay out the kitchens"". I should have listened. I really should have listened. 

When I was overweight, if I got a message from a guy, it was always from an overweight guy or a guy I just wouldn't go for. But the reality of it is, they were in my league when I was overweight, and even they knew that. Now, I get messages from guys I would genuinely be proud to date. Attractive, handsome, hardworking, and ambitious men. I have a date planned soon, and I'm so excited. I haven't dated since I was 19 years old. And that ex-boyfriend is now married and has children, and has started a whole life. And I've just been fat. Oh my god. I cry as I type that part. But that has been my reality. I've just been sitting here this whole time. Hiding myself and only showing up for food.

I feel like I had died. I was dead all those years I was overweight. I didn't feel like I was alive. Being overweight killed me. I let the people who I trusted the most kill me. And the weapons were forks, self-hate and negative thoughts. But I'm back alive now, and they all can shit themselves. 

Life is a movie, and I have a star role to play in Life.

1ogegsc,Affectionate-Fun3182,Calorie help needed,"Hi everyone, I'm a 38y F, currently 67kg and 167cm. I am trying to get to 58kg as a starting goal over the next few months. 

I have recently started a 4 day/week weights routine for the last 5 weeks, and opted to start between 1500-1600 cals (protein is around 110g per day). There have been no changes to the scale, if anything I've gone up about a kg! No changes in measurements either and my clothes aren't fitting any better. 

I was hoping to see at least a small change in weight but that hasn't happened and I am feeling disheartened. Using different tdee calculators have given me so many varying maintenance cal amounts, I have no idea where I'm meant to be. Reaching out to see if anyone else in the same weight and height range has had success in losing the kg and the calories that helped you get there? Is higher or lower the way to go?

Some things about me besides my weight incase you like any of them and we can bond. I work from home and have no kids. I love cats. My favorite thing to do is read (I’ve read 124 books this year 😅).

1ogd94b,No-Definition-2730,Can I not workout my lower body?,"I’m a bit confused right now. My lower body is already pretty big (some muscle but mostly fat) , and I really don’t want it to grow more(without any weightlifting). I’ve been in a calorie deficit and trying to work toward being able to do pull-ups, so I feel like having less lower-body mass would help.

Ideally, I want my legs to look leaner and smaller — more of that skinny, toned look with a thigh gap. Because of that, I’ve been skipping lower-body workouts, but I sometimes feel guilty about it. At first, I tried substituting leg days with running, but to be honest, I haven’t even been running that often anymore.

So my question is: is it okay if I just stop training my lower body and focus on my upper body and core?

1oft3dn,Grmnear19,Morbidly obese and want to start walking.,"Hello! Really scared to post but here goes. 

I am morbidly obese, as per my doctor. I'm about 5ft 5in and 160kg. I want to lose weight, but living with Bipolar II, things can get quite difficult. (Not scapegoating, just painting a picture.) 

I recently started walking, but after about 1k+ steps I get winded, my legs and knees buckle, and my back starts to hurt. I read somewhere that about 4k steps is the daily minimum. 

Question is, is it okay to go 2K steps in the morning and then do the 2K in the afternoon or evening, or does it have to be in one go? 

Also, I live in a high incline area. Does going downhill or uphill affect my step target?

1og92r3,Sorry-Document-732,How do you find the motivation?,"Hey y'all, 

I have been stuck in my head this night and doing the good ol' belittling of myself  for my lack of motivation. Ya know, the usual.

I'm currently the heaviest and biggest i have ever been and I simply just can't find a routine that sticks. I'm well knowledgeble in how to lose weight, the theory of it all, but for the life of me I can't stick to anything substantial for a period longer than 2 days. 

I know that I am somewhat close to my daily calorie intake limit currently, probably a little bit above it (if I summarize the entire week) so I would need to add some additional steps to move forward. Like, working out, or moving my body more than what's required during everyday stuff.
The main issue is that my brain is simply not on board with that. Even the ""let's take the stairs instead of the escalator""-method is not working, and it's honestly embarrassing at this point. 

I used to be active as hell a couple of years ago but shit happens and now I have basically not exercised since before Covid lockdown and I have just been eating like shit as well. So I know this is all in my head, and I can't possible be alone in this mindset and current slump, so what do you guys use to get yourself going when it just feels so pointless and like you're stuck?

I eat balanced (but have issues dealing with hunger so I tend to eat more than I should at times). I do drink but on rare occasions, maybe 4 times per year. 35-40 year old male.
I have all equipment at home for a good full body workout, and a gym card. But the tools are just gathering dust (even if I like put them in places that make them obstacles, I just avoid moving them instead). The gym membership is not even used once.

I need to drop a good 30kg (66lbs ish), which is gonna take a good while regardless but at the moment I'm at plus/minus zero basically and perhaps getting advice from people with the same or similar struggle can help me find a strategy that I can mould into something that works for me too.
It feels that if I can't turn this around now I might never do it.

my workouts have been getting progressively harder, sometimes i add weights or more reps or sets, sometimes i even do another routine on top. on rest days i go for an hour or two long walk and try some new calisthenics move on my feed lol (i usually fail to recreate them), or do a stretching routine

1of7mzx,sickosenjumode,Personal trainer put me on a no carb diet and I’m over it,"Has anyone else struggled with going no carbs (i.e. no rice, bread, potatoes, etc.)?

I signed up for a personal trainer because I’ve always struggled staying committed to getting healthy and he talked me into a nutrition plan. I’m fine with most of the recommendations in the plan and have been following the outline but he’s insistent I do no carbs for 8 weeks. It’s day 5 and I’ve decided to just switch to low carb. I’ve been researching and none of the benefits of going completely no carb is worth it to me. I can eat healthy with carbs.

1oft2ls,Deep_Definition1854,DIET TIPS FOR 67KG 4'11 GIRLY 🥹,"
I just really need to let this out — lately, I’ve been feeling so ugly and unhappy with my body. I used to weigh 54 kg, and now I’m at 67 kg. I can see such a big difference, especially since I’m only 4'11"". My face looks so different now, and every time I look in the mirror, I barely recognize myself. It honestly hurts because I’ve lost the confidence I used to have.

I work as a call center agent, and I know the lifestyle plays a part — the night shifts, sitting for long hours, the stress, and the irregular meals — but still, I can’t help but feel bad about how I look. I miss feeling confident, comfortable, and happy in my own skin.

1of2gsy,ljipton,I have never been heavier,"I'm a 168 cm (5'6"") female in my late 20s and today I stepped on a scale after a while. It showed 74.4 kg (164 lbs) and I've never been heavier. 

The past few years have been full of self-indulgence and excuses — thoughts like *“I’m under stress right now, there are more important things to worry about than food and how much I eat.”* Every time it was *“just this one sweet, I deserve it, things are hard,”* or mindlessly eating bread and sandwiches instead of a proper meal.

But none of that has done me any good. It’s become much harder for me to engage in any physical activity I normally enjoy. I've been getting sick way more often. I feel bad both from the food I eat and from all the failed diets and broken promises I’ve made to myself and others about changing my ways.

So now I’ve decided — no more exceptions and no more indulgence. My kind of *“self-love”* needs to be discipline, not leniency. And I don’t plan on telling anyone around me about it, because so much energy gets wasted on conversations, discussions, advice, and opinions. I want to put all that energy into actually making the effort to eat healthy and nourishing food — the way I want to — but haven’t allowed myself to until now. I think that’s for the best anyway, because eating healthy isn’t some accomplishment; it’s adult behavior, and it shouldn’t even be a topic of conversation, but something that simply goes without saying.

In any case, I wanted to share this with a community that probably understands how I feel and relates to what I’m going through. I hope you, too, find a way to make time for yourself and your health, or that this gives you some encouragement to keep going. I plan to post my results in a month so I can track my progress, and I hope to lose 4 kg (9 lbs) by then.",49,32,2025-10-24T22:02:23,WeightLossAdvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/1of2gsy/i_have_never_been_heavier/,0.93,True,/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/1of2gsy/i_have_never_been_heavier/,2025-10-27T19:23:47.037817,"I have never been heavier I'm a 168 cm (5'6"") female in my late 20s and today I stepped on a scale after a while.

Diner differs, but an average meal is pasta pesto with chicken or a plate of vegetables, meat and red potatoes. I lift heavy weights 3 times a week.
I go to sleep around 9 pm

Above are my labs from Libre 3 CGM for the last 14 days.

I do something wrong because my labs aren’t that good, right? I drink occasionally but mostly red wine or wodka cola zero. 
I saw a big spike to 14 mol/l after eating 3 pancakes with syrup.

Sorry for my English, but I think it’s better than your Dutch :)

1oew6u6,ArtsyFartsyAutie,Significant A1C reduction with plant-based diet,"Happy to report that I just had my follow up blood work and my A1C dropped from 7.5 to 5.7 in three months by following a strict whole food plant-based diet.

I have been taking it for 2+ years at this point and had no issues after the initial adjustment.

For months I've been having GI issues (extreme bloating, pain and diarrhea). Initially it was inconsistent, I'd be fine for weeks, then have a bad week etc., so I didn't link it with the metformin, but after cutting out gluten, starting to eat meat (was vegetarian), keeping a low fodmap diet for months I feel like it's getting worse? I'm looking into some gynecological issues, but I'm starting to wonder if it's the medication causing this because I can't seem to have any safe foods anymore, or at least, not consistently.

Have any of you experienced this? Taking it for years and then suddenly being unable to tolerate it?

1oeq1j8,Own-Sky-3748,Anybody else getting wildly inaccurate readings from Dexcom G6?,"This is nuts. In the last 3 weeks, I have had to change my sensor 3 times and each time it slowly goes off the rails like this. I’ve calibrated, I’ve picked different spots, and yet each time, it slowly goes off the rails until the low glucose alarm starts ringing non-stop. Just now, I saw the worst difference I’ve ever seen. It showed me below 40 when a finger stick tells me I’m actually at 139 mg/dl- off by a whopping 100 units or more!

It may have been happening longer than just the last few weeks too. I was diagnosed with congenital hyperinsulinism (CHI) as a youth, which basically means that my pancreas produces wildly too much insulin. Normally it goes away in adulthood, but mine stuck around unknown to me until it eventually caused me to develop T2D. However, when my diabetes get well-controlled, the pendulum swings back to CHI, so it’s not unusual for me to have hypoglycemia from time to time. What is unusual though, is it seems like my Dexcom G6 is getting less reliable as time goes on. I wonder how many “hypoglycemic” episodes I’ve treated in myself by now that have caused my blood sugar to skyrocket instead.

1oe3uwx,McBean215,"Diagnosed Yesterday, looking for general advice","Hi Everyone.  I was diagnosed yesterday at a follow-up for my blood work from my annual checkup.  I had been ""Pre-diabetic"" for about 4-5 years already, and definetly let some lifestyle choices slip last year as my wife was pregnant, and have obviously passed over the threshold.  I'm not surprised, but am disappointed that I let it get to this point.

I've been prescribed Metformin which seems very common as I scanned a few posts on here.  I've been working on losing the ""baby weight"" already this year (15lbs and counting) so my doctor and I think I'm already on a good path excercising, but will obviously make some additional changes on the diet side.

This Metformin is the first long-term prescribed drug I've had in my life, so my main advice seeking is how everyone handles this.  I've been prescribed two pills a day, and have been told to take with food.  I typically skip breakfast, so I'll have to get back into that habit - any advice on quick breakfasts that I can mostly grab-and-go?  Does anyone skip breakfast and still take Metformin?  I've gotten queasy taking pain meds on an empty stomach, so I'm going to take these with breakfast for at least the first couple weeks.  I did see some spots that say the Metformin has increased efficacy if taken 30min before a meal, but the vast majority still says take with/after eating.  Regardless, I'm going to wait a while and do plenty more research before tinkering with any timing.

I travel 4-5 days a month for work.  I don't feel like schlepping my huge 90-day pill bottle across the country - are there any good products for dividing out pills?  My initial thought was dumping a dozen pills into a film cartridge and throwing it into my toiletry bag, but I'm open to more elegant suggestions.  Similar question for business dinners - any tips for taking medications without having to keep a pill-bottle in your pocket for the evening?

Any other general advice is welcome.

1odocns,Chellanthe,Just wanted to share good news: had my A1C check today: 6.8% 🥹,"1/ yes, I know, there's room for improvement. That's always going to be true. I'm okay with being a work in progress. :)
2/ I started off 14++ earlier this year and my PCP stressed the need for a gentle slope of reduction in sugars so complications wouldn't plague me as much. 
3/ I started off with metformin but had an intolerance to it so moved to Jairdiance + glipizide.
4/ Physical activity? Walking when the weather/timing allows for it, otherwise the stationary bike is my bae. Usually 5-12 miles a day, usually around 8 is my aim as I'm recovering from a major surgery. 
5/ Foods? I cut out added sugars, limit carbs, I take responsibility for curating what I eat. I'm not perfect but it's a genuine effort. 
6/ Cheat meals? I think that's the wrong way to look at it. The diet isn't a punishment. I want to live. However, I will have things that I genuinely take pleasure in eating when I can, but the trick is you must be mindful of portion and probably go under the recommendation. Snacks are fine, but know what you can eat. Cater to YOUR metabolism.
7/ I can't afford a CGM and I don't stick myself like crazy because that's not sustainable, but I do log at least twice a day and if I feel off for any reason. Every few weeks, I'll do a more detailed log for a normal day. 
8/ I've lost some weight too. Still on the fledgling part of that journey because I've been overweight most of my life and I have other factors that add to metabolic dysfunction. However, I've built some muscle finally (leg days are great) which does weigh more than fat and while I've been losing fat, I'm finally showing it on the scale.
9/ The medical emergency with my gallbladder removal kinda killed my appetite (violently throwing up for 5 days will do that) and the weight loss there was deceptive because I couldn't drink or eat and I was dangerously dehydrated for the duration. I feel like today's numbers better reflected my losses because it's not based on crisis numbers. 
10/ Bad days happen. Feel your feelings. Be mad. Cry if you need to. Do the work. Small changes will have an impact. This number is a result of 7-8 months of work, bringing my A1C down at least 7-8 points (I started off as 14++, literally off the charts, I was living with dangerous numbers which hadn't obviously impacted me at that point so it wasn't for very long. It's suspected inflammation from COVID was the trigger point, but that's difficult to confirm). 

I know I've posted on here about bad days. My last post was me whining about my A1C check coming up and me not even wanting to know because this last month has been hell with the surgery and my erratic numbers because of how the gall bladder messing up and then removal messes with insulin resistance.

Are we not supposed to wear flexible sole shoes? Does it cause more issues? Most of the diabetic feet shoes I see in store/online are very bendable and very flexible. 

I had one doctor tell me I need to wear super comfortable protective shoes - soft step, memory foam-like, stretchy slip-on, rubber sole. Then another doctor said I need to focus more on arch support and width without the shoe being super flexible or my feet will feel all hard surfaces and be sore.

After multiple toes bruising incident from steel toe boots and being diagnosed with T2 in the same week (four months ago), I bought a pair of these house shoes. Yes they are soft and expanding wide toe box but lately I have been wondering if my feet are always feeling so easily tired and swollen from wearing work shoes and sneakers because my feet are so used to these shoes at home. 

Also, could the rubber soles on these shoes really not be beneficial to my diabetic feet? Because they are also fleece/cotton structure, my feet do slide around inside them sometimes. I put in a Dr. Scholl's insole but I still don't dash or quick step in them they are sort of that clog shape where you shouldn't. 

Just curious if I should go with one doctor's direction and/or reshop. Thank you!

1odjxqk,Appropriate-Bit-6386,What can I eat with this blood sugar?,"I am newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes 3 weeks ago. My A1C was 9.4 (up from 6.8 in January). My fasting blood sugar that day was 248. I was really surprised by that because I had made good lifestyle changes. I had fasted for more than 12 hours and I had had a late meal before that that did not include any added sugars or bread or pasta. 

I have not been checking my blood sugar because they said that is not necessarily something that you need to do unless you take insulin. I did buy a monitor just to satisfy my curiosity and know what I actually have going on. I had gestational diabetes so I know how to use it. I had not used it yet, but today I've been feeling so sick... I took my blood sugar 2.5 hours after I ate and it was 333. I wonder if that is what made me feel crummy because that's the highest I've ever seen it. An hour after that, it was 328. I can't seem to get it below 300. I drink water and I did exercise like my diabetic educator told me to do if I ever found myself having a high number. 
I still feel very sick, and I'm not sure if it has anything to do with the blood sugar or not but I am also very hungry, but I'm actually scared to eat because Google is telling me that 300+ is pretty bad.
I'm sorry if this seems like a stupid question, but what should I be eating? I can't just not eat, but I am afraid to eat because I feel like I don't want to spike my sugar since it doesn't seem to be going down.

I have found that running or swimming for ~30 minutes in the mornings before work about 30 minutes after breakfast has been a huge boon to my blood sugar throughout the day. With meal prepping lunches a few days at a time and breakfast/coffee the night before while I make dinner, I still find myself needing to wake up 3 hours or 2.5 hours before my shift begins, whether leaving from mine or my partner’s place, in order to consistently be on time for work. I find I have about 4.5 hours after commuting from work before I should be winding down for bed, during which I can have chores, an errand, and time I need to spend exorcising more in order to maintain blood sugar I am comfortable with. 

Today, I was going to meet up with a good friend for a shared hobby. This is already at some cost to my routine, typically some of it being my sleep (which I’d really like at least 7 hours of) and some after work exorcise. My manager approached me at work today letting me know that I’ll need to be in a couple hours early to cover a work task. I let my friend know this, and asked if we could try rescheduling for Friday. They were rightfully upset. This isn’t the first time I’ve recently flaked due to what feels like any unexpected change to a schedule made more demanding by diabetes.

I realize this isn’t specifically a diabetes problem, but it feels like this issue has been exacerbated in my life since my diagnosis and the measures needed to take care of myself. How have y’all managed packing your diabetes routines into your schedules? Are there any tips or hacks y’all have made, allowing for stronger commitments to the things you enjoy in your lives?",1,2,2025-10-23T03:05:41,diabetes_t2,https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes_t2/comments/1odladx/routine_struggles/,1.0,True,/r/diabetes_t2/comments/1odladx/routine_struggles/,2025-10-27T19:25:20.087653,"Routine Struggles I’ve been so flaky with friends recently, and I really need to fix this.

1odftqc,Obvious_Dog_7082,Learning curves,"

I just recently got diagnosed at the age of 28. I saw it coming with a long line of diabetics in my family tree. However, I never thought it would come this early. I have been struggling to find the right food choices and really appreciate my cgm.It has helped at lot! 

That said I always wake up with high numbers even around 150 sometimes as high as 170 and that's with a dosage increase. I have read about the dawn phenomenon but my numbers do not start to fall down until 2pm then it drops to around 105. I've tried intermittent fasting , eating a small break fast first thing in the morning  and eating early dinner nothing seems to help.

 By the evening my blood sugar is not nearly as touchy however in the morning even the smallest bit of carbs sends my blood sugar sky rocket. Ie a cup of coffee with a splash of cream will land me in the 210s range

My doctor put me on metformin and gave me glipizide to work congruently. But it does not make any difference on my morning - afternoon numbers. 

Does any one have any tips or can relate ? ",1,10,2025-10-22T23:38:46,diabetes_t2,https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes_t2/comments/1odftqc/learning_curves/,0.67,True,/r/diabetes_t2/comments/1odftqc/learning_curves/,2025-10-27T19:25:25.390388,"Learning curves

I talked to doc and am doing a trial of no metformin with daily insulin increased from 12u to 15u. This was a week ago. Since then the stomach issues have gone and I can finally trust farts again haha. But the dizziness and weirdness remains.

1od5rqz,InaFromChina,CGM Locations,"I just recently decided to try wearing my G7 somewhere other than my arms and I *LOVE* it. So I was curious to know where others have tried?

I had success doing K\*\*O  years back.  My A1C went down, I lost weight and my mood and inflammation in my body improved.  BUT Pandemic happened, I went through Menopause etc stress.. so I struggled to get back to that kind of eating. .(I was eating a lot more vegetables mind you but the fat increased my saity a lot... and I was doing more Intermittent fasting as well.  )

Anyway,  so I got my CGM and it is giving me interesting readings.. I Had been on a dose of prednisone earlier this year that raised my A1C to 8 and my blood sugar levels were HIGH.  I was finally seeing better results that were in the 150s (vs the over 200 + consistant readings) . I have cut out more carbs and sugar but I am not perfect at it.  I go to the food bank they shove a 1/2 gallon of icecream at me.... uh ok.. frustrating. 

But the one thing I am finally able to see is the DAWN phenomena. OMG.. 250.....  

It is interesting though.. My alarm went off (and woke me up at 5am) to inform me I had a 250 reading.   At around 6, it went down to 225 and now it is back up to 255...  (Drinking black coffee with coconut oil and Acacia Fiber) and it went up..   

I probably will need to try and start with water.. lemon water or something..

1obvqsz,FarPomegranate7437,My experience with Wegovy,"I just got me A1c back after about 3 months on a GLP-1, and my A1c is even better than it was before I started them meds despite not having exercised as regularly as I should and being a little looser about my diet.

Jan 2025: 7.1
June 2025: 5.3
October 2025: 5

I did put in a lot of hard work including a complete overhaul of my diet and obsessively tracking everything for the first couple of months after diagnosis. I was also exercising from 45-75 minutes per day before my second A1c test. While that is probably how I should be living my life, I found it to be a pretty huge mental load. I saw an endo at the end of June after my second A1c and asked her if she recommended anything to help increase my insulin sensitivity. She put me on Wegovy, which I started in mid July. 

I was super surprised to find my number so great, especially since I haven’t been exercising very regularly since I threw my back out due to bad side effects from a statin in July. I have been conscious about my diet, but nowhere near as obsessive as I was the first several months. In any case, Wegovy has been a game changer for me, even if it hasn’t caused me to lose much weight. I’m in it for the insulin sensitivity more than anything, and it has shown that it does its job in that regard! 

I’m not suggesting that people take meds, especially if they’re uncomfortable with them, but I have found it to be a game changer for me, although I am definitely getting back in the gym when I can! I know this doesn’t mean I can go back to my old lifestyle, but I’m so glad to have a mental and emotional load taken off my shoulders!

Update:
Just got my C-peptide and fasting insulin tests back! This is probably even more illustrative of the effects of Wegovy!

I have been conscious about my diet, but nowhere near as obsessive as I was the first several months. In any case, Wegovy has been a game changer for me, even if it hasn’t caused me to lose much weight. I’m in it for the insulin sensitivity more than anything, and it has shown that it does its job in that regard! 

I’m not suggesting that people take meds, especially if they’re uncomfortable with them, but I have found it to be a game changer for me, although I am definitely getting back in the gym when I can! I know this doesn’t mean I can go back to my old lifestyle, but I’m so glad to have a mental and emotional load taken off my shoulders!

Update:
Just got my C-peptide and fasting insulin tests back! This is probably even more illustrative of the effects of Wegovy!

1obhltk,ShopNerd,Any way to stay lower over night?,"So question for someone more experienced than I. My numbers are solid over the last 7 months since good old diagnosis but I notice basically every night theres a steady rise no matter what i go to sleep at. I go to sleep at a 6, I end up waking up above am 8 or even 9. 

I understand this is likely just my liver and dawn phenomenon but I'm wondering if there's a way to mitigate this without the use of overnight or slow acting insulin. Maybe there's better food practices or something I can do before bed to keep me down or stop this rise. I've tried light workouts before bed, eating something low carb like broccoli or chia pudding and even tried sleeping earlier or later and none of that seems to help.

1o9iaof,AntGroundbreaking102,medication makes everything worse,"i’ve been diagnosed for eight years and was immediately put on metformin. since the beginning, i’ve had awful side effects. it made me throw up multiple times a day. some days i couldn’t even keep water down. how i managed to go to school and work is a miracle. i can’t even tell you how many times i had to pull over the side of the road to puke. i ran a low grade fever every day with no break for like three years (like 99.9). doctors weren’t concerned bc it was so low. and it didn’t go away. i was still going through it seven years later. no doctor believed me. all they kept saying, “that’s not supposed to happen.” and did nothing about it.

the final straw was last fall when i was throwing up every 10 minutes or so. i stopped all medication and never felt better. metformin also started effecting my mental health. i had never ending brain fogs, haziness, dark thoughts and i started harming myself. when i stopped it, everything suddenly cleared up. i felt better mentally and physically for the first time in years. i started sleeping better (better for me, ive had insomnia since i was 2) and generally felt so so good.

then the doctor convinced me to go on jardiance and… it’s pretty much the same. i’m not running a continuous fever but i do run a high one (101.1) every night around 9 but it’s gone by morning. i’ve been dizzy for like six weeks. getting overheated. i haven’t slept since *monday* and just flat out feeling awful. the worst part is? none of the medication has ever worked for me. i think ive only had an a1c below 10 once despite diet and exercise. its so bad i dont even eat anymore for fear ill just throw it up bc i have.

i’m on once a day insulin and it makes my stomach cramp so bad i have to lay in bed with a heating pad. i’ve *never* had stomach cramps before. and i can’t take GLP-1’s bc ozempic gave me pancreatitis twice. i’m so close to giving up. i just want to feel better 😢",2,1,2025-10-18T06:22:48,diabetes_t2,https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes_t2/comments/1o9iaof/medication_makes_everything_worse/,0.58,True,/r/diabetes_t2/comments/1o9iaof/medication_makes_everything_worse/,2025-10-27T19:26:51.553072,"medication makes everything worse i’ve been diagnosed for eight years and was immediately put on metformin. since the beginning, i’ve had awful side effects. it made me throw up multiple times a day. some days i couldn’t even keep water down. how i managed to go to school and work is a miracle. i can’t even tell you how many times i had to pull over the side of the road to puke. i ran a low grade fever every day with no break for like three years (like 99.9). doctors weren’t concerned bc it was so low. and it didn’t go away. i was still going through it seven years later. no doctor believed me. all they kept saying, “that’s not supposed to happen.” and did nothing about it.

1i9lxys,blackaubreyplaza,Hit my goal weight!,"Here are some wild before and current pictures. I started on wegovy in August 2023 and moved to ozempic for insurance reasons. I’m 5’3” and my starting weight was 271. I’ve lost 136lbs and made it to the weight I’m going to maintain, 135lbs, right before vacation last week. 

Happy to answer any questions! But here are the things I’ve seen people ask / talk about over the last year and a half: 

Yes I work out. I’m the person saying I workout 7 days a week 2x a day. I plan to continue this through maintenance. I also cut out a lot of foods and didn’t drink for 1 year and 4 months. I did have a couple drinks on vacation but still can’t get drunk or buzzed. I don’t think booze will be part of my life while I’m in maintenance for this reason, and I was formerly an enthusiastic social drinker. I’m going to lose 10 more lbs before I talk to my doctor about a maintenance dose so I have that wiggle room to figure out what dose will be best. Yes I’ve lost a ton of hair, NO I’m not any healthier or happier. I’m not a “completely different person” so although you may mean well you can respectfully keep those comments to yourself 🖤! I am still all about fat liberation and total body neutrality.  

Socially no one treats me any different. No one has made any weird comments about my body or weight loss. Dating isn’t any better, I def pulled more dudes as a class III obese person. Physically I don’t feel any different, but I didn’t have any mobility issues previously. 

That’s it! Again feel free to ask any questions! Hopefully this is helpful and best of luck to everyone, you got this!

I don’t think booze will be part of my life while I’m in maintenance for this reason, and I was formerly an enthusiastic social drinker. I’m going to lose 10 more lbs before I talk to my doctor about a maintenance dose so I have that wiggle room to figure out what dose will be best. Yes I’ve lost a ton of hair, NO I’m not any healthier or happier. I’m not a “completely different person” so although you may mean well you can respectfully keep those comments to yourself 🖤! I am still all about fat liberation and total body neutrality.  

Socially no one treats me any different. No one has made any weird comments about my body or weight loss. Dating isn’t any better, I def pulled more dudes as a class III obese person. Physically I don’t feel any different, but I didn’t have any mobility issues previously. 

That’s it! Again feel free to ask any questions! Hopefully this is helpful and best of luck to everyone, you got this!

1hz9qsr,Relative-Dark-226,Weightloss Journey,"Height: 5'8""
Starting Weight (SW): 240 lbs (43.5-35-47 in)
Starting Weight Before Ozempic (3rd pic): 205 lbs (44-33-46 in)
Current Weight (CW): 158 lbs (39-28.5-40.5 in)
Total Weight Lost: ~82 lbs

My Story
In 2020, my insurance switched my birth control from NuvaRing to a generic brand, EluRyng. Unfortunately, I gained 50 lbs because of it. I stopped using it in 2021 and managed to lose some of the weight, but between 2021 and 2023, I kept fluctuating between 190-210 lbs.

I tried everything: working out, eating healthy, even taking Metformin I ordered online and Phentermine from a med spa. Phentermine, in particular, gave me terrible side effects, so I talked to my primary care provider. They recommended Ozempic, and thankfully, my insurance approved it.

I started Ozempic in January 2024, and as of today, I’ve lost about 50 lbs at a steady rate of 0.5-1 lb per week. I’ve been on the maximum dose of 2 mg for about 4 months now.

My Approach
I intentionally chose to lose weight slowly because I wanted to avoid loose skin and set myself up for long-term success. I aim to eat around 1,500 calories per day because I eventually plan to wean off

Weight History

At 18 years old: 208 lbs
At 25 years old: 155 lbs
At 36 years old (now): 158 lbs
My weight has fluctuated my entire life, so my body is somewhat used to these changes. Ive never been pregnant btw.

It’s been a challenging journey, but I’m finally in a place where I feel more confident and healthy.",1663,212,2025-01-12T05:33:48,Ozempic,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hz9qsr,0.98,False,/r/Ozempic/comments/1hz9qsr/weightloss_journey/,2025-10-27T19:27:29.312499,"Weightloss Journey Height: 5'8""

I wfh so I don’t have a huge need to replace any of my clothes; however, I’m on an extended vacation for the holiday and quickly realized the three pairs of jeans I have that “fit” me, didn’t actually fit me well at all… I went thrift shopping expecting to go down one pant size… I WENT DOWN TWO!!!! I fit into a size 4!!!!! I was NOT expecting that AT ALL! I still see myself as big, I can’t seem to wrap my head around the changing size of my body.

It’s so easy now to eat only when I’m hungry and stop when I’m full and exercise to take my mind off my stress.🥳🥹",happy ozempic experience really think could heavy start last time beginning august tired try fail hope pray beginning rest life struggle eat emotionally find soothing comfort food would also never stop eat full food still yummy whole mindset change easy eat hungry stop full exercise take mind stress,"['happy', 'ozempic', 'experience', 'really', 'think', 'could', 'heavy', 'start', 'last', 'time', 'beginning', 'august', 'tired', 'try', 'fail', 'hope', 'pray', 'beginning', 'rest', 'life', 'struggle', 'eat', 'emotionally', 'find', 'soothing', 'comfort', 'food', 'would', 'also', 'never', 'stop', 'eat', 'full', 'food', 'still', 'yummy', 'whole', 'mindset', 'change', 'easy', 'eat', 'hungry', 'stop', 'full', 'exercise', 'take', 'mind', 'stress']",48,post,1jv9jcl
12usv0d,Choco_donut2222,I’ve been off of ozempic for past 5 months… this is what happened,"12/2023 update: it’s been almost a year since I stopped ozempic. The lowest I weighed was 140 and right now I’m 145. It’s been going up and down but it’s always around 145ish. So after one year of stopping ozempic, I gained 5 pounds. I’ll take it. 


Ok, so ever since I had my two children, I gained 50 pounds and I just couldn’t get rid of the weight no matter what I did. I guess my hormones and metabolism got all messed up after having kids, so I decided to try ozempic from last April to November. Thankfully I lost 50 pounds so I’m back to my pre-kids weight so I’m very pleased. I really wanted to stop using ozempic since I had no desire to lose more weight, but at the same time, I was hesitant to stop using it due to everyone saying you gain back everything. Coincidentally my insurance changed and they stopped covering it so I naturally just stopped the medication after my last dose at the end of November. Since the medication stays in your body for 4-6 weeks, I didn’t gain any weight back from December to January. Then when February hit, I could tell that my appetite was through the roof and I started eating. But that happened for like the first two weeks and then I had to start controlling myself so I was extra conscious of what I was eating, when I was eating, etc (also mdoing exercises). Overall, I’ve gained 4 pounds and I’m maintaining it. I could definitely see why you gain back everything once off of the medicine due to your appetite going back to normal or even higher. However if you’re conscious of your diet and do exercises, you won’t gain all the weight back!! all the studies and media make it sound like you bounce back up or higher after stopping ozempic , but ultimately you can control it!!!

Edit: ok, the reason I posted this is for those who don’t want to be on ozempic forever. I simply used ozempic as a tool to get my weight loss started and since it did its job, it’s my job to maintain it. I stumbled a few times because my appetite was so high after stopping it, but it went back down and Ive been stable with my weight (after gaining 4 pounds)  by doing HIT and peloton but most importantly eating the right food at the right time. I’m a pharmacist so I’m not someone who doesn’t know how to read the clinical studies. Those of you who are negative and say that all the weight will come back, maybe it’ll come back for you but at the rate of what I’m doing to maintain, I don’t think that’s the case. Good luck to all.

1fus91c,Wintaru,"13 months on Ozempic, soon to be done","For my birthday I was diagnosed with diabetes last year. The before photo was right around that time, but not my heaviest ever (that is the last comparison photo). We tried metformin etc at first but I couldn’t tolerate it so I got the OK from insurance to try Ozempic.

Had hip surgery in November last year (torn labrum and they released my IT band), which is my 6th surgery in the past 10 years, all my joints are shot from being overweight. In March I started lifting weights 4x a week and in May I started biking 40 miles a week. Was astonished to find I could bike daily and not be super sore from the bike seat 😅

Told my doc I’d like to try going off it next year. Deductible will reset and I can’t eat enough protein to do much good with the weight lifting. I count calories religiously (I weigh everything) and I’m at about 1300 per day, on a good day. Some days I don’t make it past 1100 calories even with all my activity. 

I plateaued for 4 months from February through May, then lost another 25lbs over the summer. Super close to my goal, which was 160 but I’m kinda hoping to get into the 150’s before I go off it and start focusing on building muscle. We will see. I am 46 years old and 5’10” so I don’t think 150’s is out of the question. I went from size 48 waist and I just bought jeans last week that are size 30. Might squeeze into 28’s before this is all over lol.

If anyone is on the fence about trying it I would say go for it honestly. I’m super disappointed in myself that I let things get that bad. Lots of loose skin and I don’t think I’ll ever build enough muscle to fill it out again at my age. Pissed off that I threw my late 20’s and all of my 30’s away like that.

14d28kb,imdrinkingcauseimsad,"Since ozempic is in the news and the healthy people are somehow pissed about it, listen up.","Update: did not expect this to blow up, glad I’m getting what so many people want to say out there. I just want to correct one thing, I went from 392-292lbs with life style changes focusing a lot on my relationship with food. Then I plateaued hard. An endocrinologist helped me through it, fixed my testosterone and got Ozempic that helped me break the plateau and be able to maintain my current weight with minimal effort. 


392lb was my max, now I’m hovering at 185-190 thanks to ozempic. While I was dropping fast, the people who’d tell me to ‘stop losing weight as I’d look too haggard’ were the exact people who spent their whole lives telling me that I should lose weight.

Fuck them. Even if they’re your family. People treat me so differently now it’s insanely infuriating, was I not a person before? But this is the reality of it. Whatever the reason, obesity is an easy boogeyman and ‘it’s cure’ is the simplest right? ‘Eat less, move more’, no fucking clue about the inner workings of the disease. IT AFFECTS US TO THE FUCKING CELLULAR LEVEL.

If ozempic is a novelty drug that should be restricted then why are people who have never been able to lose weight successfully suddenly doing it now? Covid changed their life? They got old? Maybe.

But it’s fucking Semaglutide, the drug that finally addresses obesity in a multi prong attack that doesn’t wreck your CNS/CVS and only is risky when not titrated properly and if you’re the unlucky ones with a specific form of thyroid cancer.

Besides that, you’re good. Make lifestyle changes with the help of mental health professionals and the weight will work out much better for you in the long run either way regardless of ozempic. The studies have proven that the people who get off Semaglutide do not put back their baseline amount of weight, and when you spend half your fucking life being 300 odd lbs that’s a big fucking deal.

Sorry, this is a lot of anger but people just don’t get it. This isn’t a fucking moral failure, it’s a fucking disease. I mean why don’t you just control your blood pressure by reducing stress and calming down? Should work right? Heart problems? Chilllax boi, bring that heart rate down.

Fucking stupid. Stupid. Thanks to the assholes who had to use it to lose the 15 lbs they couldn’t get off for their shitty middle aged suburbia cocktail parties to fit in their shit suits/dresses. Guess what; it’s not a choice we made, there are physiological and psychological forces at play here that we barely even understand yet.

In the future, this will be laughed at as usual, just like treating substance use disorder like a crime. Fucking, stupid.

TLDR: Fuck you. Ozempic is saving lives and making a huge amount of people finally beat a disease that is growing rapidly and has devastating consequences in the long run. 200 odd lbs lost yet still stuck with 200 odd lbs of bullshit. Fuck off. Unless you’ve carried the weight, lived with it, and lost it, shut the fuck up.

Update: did not expect this to blow up, glad I’m getting what so many people want to say out there. I just want to correct one thing, I went from 392-292lbs with life style changes focusing a lot on my relationship with food. Then I plateaued hard. An endocrinologist helped me through it, fixed my testosterone and got Ozempic that helped me break the plateau and be able to maintain my current weight with minimal effort. 


392lb was my max, now I’m hovering at 185-190 thanks to ozempic. While I was dropping fast, the people who’d tell me to ‘stop losing weight as I’d look too haggard’ were the exact people who spent their whole lives telling me that I should lose weight.

Fuck them. Even if they’re your family. People treat me so differently now it’s insanely infuriating, was I not a person before? But this is the reality of it. Whatever the reason, obesity is an easy boogeyman and ‘it’s cure’ is the simplest right? ‘Eat less, move more’, no fucking clue about the inner workings of the disease. IT AFFECTS US TO THE FUCKING CELLULAR LEVEL.

If ozempic is a novelty drug that should be restricted then why are people who have never been able to lose weight successfully suddenly doing it now? Covid changed their life? They got old? Maybe.

But it’s fucking Semaglutide, the drug that finally addresses obesity in a multi prong attack that doesn’t wreck your CNS/CVS and only is risky when not titrated properly and if you’re the unlucky ones with a specific form of thyroid cancer.

Besides that, you’re good. Make lifestyle changes with the help of mental health professionals and the weight will work out much better for you in the long run either way regardless of ozempic.

1lzk7fe,Future-Bug-9331,Finally comfortable enough to enter a gym.,"It's been a journey but I wouldn't change it for the world. 

Gone are the days of editing photos to make me look slimmer or standing behind people so my body wouldn't be on show in photos. 

I lacked so much confidence I couldnt bring myself to enter a gym for fears of being secretly judged for the way I look. So I always said that once I'd lost enough weight, I would work out. Its backwards, I know, but I chose to focus on diet and Ozempic for the bulk of my journey. But now I've finally gone from an Aus 18 to an Aus 10-12 (XXL - M) I'm not afraid anymore. 

Sure, I'm super unfit from years of avoiding exercise like the plague. And yes everything is flabby right now from all the weightloss. But I'm putting the work in and have been doing reformer pilates every 2nd day. Instead of focusing on the number so much, my new goal is toning my body and being able to hold a plank without breaking before the instructor tells us to. 

And I'm only 8kg off my initial goal, so the day that comes I will celebrate. Sure it might take a little longer now that I'm building muscle. But when it does happen, I will truly know that I have worked hard and be so proud of myself. And honestly I wouldn't have been able to do it without Ozempic (I know, I've tried so many times before - stupid PCOS).

I started Ozempic a year ago after years of failed attempts to loose weight. I have PCOS and after having IVF and a baby I just could not loose any weight. 

This stuff was a miracle honestly. I always kept to a 500 calorie deficit and reevaluated my calories to keep it accurate with my weight loss. 

The last few months I’ve stayed around the same weight which I’m happy with so I decided to lower my dose weekly until it ran out and this is the first shot day I will not be taking a shot! 

Loosing the weight have enabled me to take up running something I’ve found I enjoy so much and I’ve been completing 5k most days now which I am so proud of 🥹

1l4zpo9,ThrowRA_princess4,"I always knew something was wrong, but being on Ozempic for 2 years finally confirmed it.","A little back story: 


I’ve struggled with food for as long as I can remember. I used to have intense cravings and would gorge myself at birthday parties/holidays with junk food and dessert. When I got older, the cravings became unbearable. I also grew up in an emotionally abusive household developed a binge-eating disorder as a coping mechanism. I used to play sports in high school, so I was able to manage my weight for the most part. As I got older and experienced more trauma, the binge eating got worse. Graduating and stopping sports caused me to gain weight quite rapidly. No matter what I did, I could not stop the hunger and I did not have the ability to feel full. Exercise was AWFUL because any sort of exercise, despite me eating beforehand, made me RAVENOUSLY hungry to the point where I would be in tears trying to do squats in my living room. I kept telling my psychiatrist, therapist, doctor that I could not get rid of this hunger no matter what , and I kept getting told it was all in my head. 



Well, jokes on everyone because I’ve been on .25mg for 2 years and I can now eat like a normal fucking person. I’m 5ft tall and started at 155lbs. Im now between 115-120 and I’ve been maintaining this for over a year. It’s also crazy to me that I can now exercise without extreme hunger and tears. My life is no longer controlled by food and I cannot express how liberating it feels to eat because I want to, not because my body is screaming at me that it HAS to. 



And in my opinion, the reason I haven’t had to increase my dose is because *something* has been wrong the whole time. I’m not a medical professional, but I truly believe my body was lacking the ability to produce GLP-1 correctly. I only experienced side-effects during the first week and have had 0 since. I was genuinely in awe for the first few months because I was like “is this how normal people experience day-to-day hunger???”. Going from 24/7 cravings and constant food noise to *nothing* was a crazy experience. 



I know there is tons of stigma around using this medication for weight loss, but I’m telling you that Ozempic saved my life. 


*EDIT TO ADD BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE CANNOT READ* 

Ya’ll I am 5 feet tall. I used to work at a daycare with 10 year olds bigger than me. My mom is 4’11”. I come from a line of short people. Because I am SHORT, 155lbs is overweight FOR ME and MY HEIGHT. I understand that 155 is a low number. I’m sure if I was taller at that weight, my Dr would never have agreed to prescribe me this medication. But please… I am short and stout af.

# Common Questions



How much weight did you lose?



*I started at 293 lbs in September 2023, and today I weigh 181 lbs. (down 112 lbs)*



How have you been maintaining the weight loss?



*I am more active than ever, and I work out/exercise every day. I play a lot of team sports and am part of a running club. I have been keeping a strict diet, with a weekly cheat day. I eat a lot cleaner and less greasy fast foods / take out.*



Did the food noise come back?



*OOOH Yeah! The hunger definitely comes back, but you just need to be consistent and strict with your diet. I do believe the diet is a huge part of maintaining the weight loss. I do a weekly meal prep for my work lunches, and I eat snacks and meals that are overall healthier. I have cut out all unnecessary sugars in my beverages.*



  

Would you recommend Ozempic?



*Yes, I would recommend it to others. Ozempic really helped me to shed the weight. It was great to see the quick results. It can be discouraging when you feel like you’re doing everything right but you don’t see the scale reflecting that. If you need a kick start, and Ozempic works for you, I recommend it.*



  

Plans for the future?



*I carry a lot of hanging skin since the weight loss, so I plan to continue working out and doing strength training to fill the loose skin with muscles. I also plan on continuing my healthier lifestyle with my diet and daily exercise.*",960,121,2025-05-30T00:21:16,Ozempic,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kyiumn,0.99,False,/r/Ozempic/comments/1kyiumn/coming_off_ozempic_7_month_update/,2025-10-27T19:30:15.732374,"Coming off Ozempic - 7 Month Update I started Ozempic back in November 2023 and stopped taking it at the end of September 2024.

1k8coqw,Beneficial_Army574,"8 Months, 33kg Difference","90kg > 57kg

Just found a picture I didn't know I had in a secret folder on my phone. This is the most accurate photo I have of my highest weight, I really can't believe I use to be that big but I definitely remember how it felt. 

I found out about Ozempic and how it was helping those struggling with weight loss around the time of the before photo, unfortunately I put up with my growing knee pains from all the weight I was carrying and waited another couple of years before talking to my doctor- god why did I wait so long? I'm a lot healthier now and I should be happy, I am happy, but I'm still struggling to come to terms with the fact that I didn't have to punish myself for so long, it didn't need to be so hard, accepting myself could have been so much easier. I know your own weight shouldn't determine worth but something drives you to that point, and then when you're there nothing is simple.

**If you're thinking about trying Ozempic do it.** Call, make the appointment, haul yourself in, tell your doctor straight up why you're there, don't 'spare' them from the personal issues either ok? Whatever's going to make your case stronger do it. I still suffer from bad knees and it could have been easily avoided. You're worth being listened to, your health is important, stop putting yourself on the backburner.

Just rambling below, basically said my piece already.

Anyway, 33kg lost yay. I did get down to 52kg around November last year and have been off and on Oz since then. I'm still currently 57kg so I have gained 5 but that happened in the span of about 2 months and I've lost/gained the same 1kg since then. 

My period has just started to become irregular again (pcos girly) so I started the .25 dose today. I would like to lose more weight also, but the main priority is my cycle, so I'll gauge what dose I should be on based on that first- I also want to start exercising and see what I can lose from that too... basically playing it by ear now I guess?",924,108,2025-04-26T18:44:59,Ozempic,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k8coqw,1.0,False,/r/Ozempic/comments/1k8coqw/8_months_33kg_difference/,2025-10-27T19:30:24.599526,"8 Months, 33kg Difference 90kg > 57kg

I would like to lose more weight also, but the main priority is my cycle, so I'll gauge what dose I should be on based on that first- I also want to start exercising and see what I can lose from that too... basically playing it by ear now I guess?",difference find picture know secret folder phone accurate photo high weight really believe use big definitely remember feel find ozempic help struggle weight loss around time photo unfortunately put grow knee pain weight carry wait another couple year talk god wait long lot healthy happy happy still struggle come term fact punish long need hard accept could much easy know weight determine worth something drive point nothing simple think try ozempic call make appointment haul tell doctor straight spare personal issue either whatever make case strong still suffer bad knee could easily avoid worth listen health important stop put backburner ramble basically say piece already anyway lose yay get around november last year since still currently gain happen span lose gain since period start become irregular pco girly start dose today would like lose weight also main priority cycle gauge dose base also want start exercise see lose basically play ear guess,"['difference', 'find', 'picture', 'know', 'secret', 'folder', 'phone', 'accurate', 'photo', 'high', 'weight', 'really', 'believe', 'use', 'big', 'definitely', 'remember', 'feel', 'find', 'ozempic', 'help', 'struggle', 'weight', 'loss', 'around', 'time', 'photo', 'unfortunately', 'put', 'grow', 'knee', 'pain', 'weight', 'carry', 'wait', 'another', 'couple', 'year', 'talk', 'god', 'wait', 'long', 'lot', 'healthy', 'happy', 'happy', 'still', 'struggle', 'come', 'term', 'fact', 'punish', 'long', 'need', 'hard', 'accept', 'could', 'much', 'easy', 'know', 'weight', 'determine', 'worth', 'something', 'drive', 'point', 'nothing', 'simple', 'think', 'try', 'ozempic', 'call', 'make', 'appointment', 'haul', 'tell', 'doctor', 'straight', 'spare', 'personal', 'issue', 'either', 'whatever', 'make', 'case', 'strong', 'still', 'suffer', 'bad', 'knee', 'could', 'easily', 'avoid', 'worth', 'listen', 'health', 'important', 'stop', 'put', 'backburner', 'ramble', 'basically', 'say', 'piece', 'already', 'anyway', 'lose', 'yay', 'get', 'around', 'november', 'last', 'year', 'since', 'still', 'currently', 'gain', 'happen', 'span', 'lose', 'gain', 'since', 'period', 'start', 'become', 'irregular', 'pco', 'girly', 'start', 'dose', 'today', 'would', 'like', 'lose', 'weight', 'also', 'main', 'priority', 'cycle', 'gauge', 'dose', 'base', 'also', 'want', 'start', 'exercise', 'see', 'lose', 'basically', 'play', 'ear', 'guess']",152,post,1k8coqw

1i4mf5k,BathedInSin,I don't know who else to tell,"Hi! I'm Ashley. I've been on a weight loss journey since I was a teen. Always chubby as a kid, grew into a chubby teen. Then a chubby adult. This is my 1 month mark. 15 pounds down! A little about my journey I guess. 

When I was 21 I was working an extremely physical job in managed to get down to a weight that I wasn't even at in high school (115). For the duration of time I had that job I was an excellent shape. Then gained it all back and then some over the next year. I've done almost every diet plan you could imagine.

I had to convince doctors to put me on medication when I was in my mid 20s because I was at about 180 and I was scared. I was doing everything right but it wasn't working. I gained weight on the meds and The doctor accused me of being dishonest with all of my meticulous OCD level logs and pulled me off. Over the next few years I managed to get my self up to 240 (pic on left). 

I've done everything I could think to do. I got tested to make sure that there were no health issues and the doctors claim there's nothing medically wrong except prediabetic (diabetes runs in the family). So I finally found somebody that would listen to me and believes that there can be something medically causing this. I got approved for the semaglutide and this is the result so far. 

It's changing how I interact with food. I am not usually a big appetite person in general but this doesn't nudge when I want food (not that much anyway), it effects how much I eat in a sitting though. I CANT eat more than a fistful of food before I feel like I just ate Thanksgiving dinner and I need a break. I can't eat as much at once so it's sort of change. Instead of a medium and a large meal everyday now I'm doing a little more snacking with fruit, cheese, hummus, veggies (A girl's got to have her cucumbers). And 2 small to medium meals. It's making a huge difference and I love how I feel! 

A bunch of people don't really agree with this medication so I don't feel comfortable talking too much about it with them. I guess I just wanted some acknowledgement that it's working and worth it.

This is a post I seriously never thought I’d make when I started on this medication. May 5th, 2023 I took my first dose of this medication and finally felt ready to change my life. I had just celebrated my 28th birthday and I had no self esteem, felt old, looked older than I was, drank too much, and didn’t know where my life was going. I started at 261.3 lbs and I just wanted to be below 200 for the first time in 7 years because I couldn’t even imagine hitting that number. The first 6-7 months were pretty miserable with side effects and my doctor and I were doing the best to manage, but I was steady losing and didn’t want to give up. Then just over a year on the medicine and i hit my goal of under 200. Then I set my next goal to 165, hit that and went to 150 thinking I’d be amazed if I ever hit it. I’m proud to say that exactly 2 years later I am 30 years old 5’5 and weigh in at 133.7 lbs! I’m 3.7 lbs from my final goal 😭 this is so emotional for me as I never thought I’d get my life back. I have confidence, a great job, I’m dating again, I’ve started running, and just feel incredible waking up every day (mostly 😉). I mean it when I say that if I can do it, so can you! It wasn’t an easy or quick journey, but semaglutide has changed my life for the better.

1l65hq5,Miamiborn79,First time in 20 years I'm below 300lbs!,"I started my Journey with Semiglutide in mid October of last year. At my heaviest (Pic on the right) in July of 2024 I was 417.4 lbs. I went on a ""diet"" and managed to lose 25lbs on my own, but soon realized the weight was creeping back up and I needed help. I was a fast responder to the med. I also miraculously managed to go 11 weeks without any major GI symptoms other than constipation. Then on Christmas morning I was miserable. Vomiting, diarrhea, cramping... It was awful! Couldn't even watch my kids open presents. Went to the hospital and was diagnosed with Cholecystitis. I got my gallbladder taken out. I was off the Semiglutide for almost two weeks before starting back and GI symptoms seemed to intensify and come seemingly out of nowhere on a daily basis. At first I thought it was just my body adjusting to having no gallbladder, but nothing seemed to make it any better. I would get Sulphur burps and explosive diarrhea almost daily. Was this my new normal 

This went on until a couple weeks ago when I decided to really take the advice of many in this group and eat smaller, more frequent meals and eat much slower. Since that change, my Gi symptoms have all but dissappeared and the weight is continuing to go down, albeit a little slower now.

I took this weight loss at a different mindset. I stopped focusing on weighting myself multiple times a day, I stopped obsessing over everything I ate. I just took it a day at a time. The hard struggle with my weight was my inability to not binge eat. This medication was an absolute life changer. I have always been into fitness so that was never the issue. It was the eating. But now that I don’t have constant food noise I’m able to make better choices. I still have about 80 more pounds until I’m at my goal but I honestly don’t care about a number anymore. I feel better and that is most important. Just going to continue doing this day after day and the weight loss will continue. Happy I made this change for myself.

Also shamelessly really pleased with myself and outside of my partner and best friend no one knows I'm on wegovy! I also don't discuss weight publicly for personal reasons and because I believe all bodies deserve acceptance regardless of size. Hence showing off here 💕

I lost 53lbs in total but it took 1 year and 10 months at a rate of 0.5lbs a week. I have gone from a dress size 16 UK to between 12 and 10 (US 12 to US 6)

Currently: 163lbs BMI 22.7 
My goal weight was 157lbs but I am happy here.

I buy wegovy privately in the UK, and I didn't diet. Now the food noise is gone I try to eat intuitively. I love the Japanese eating principle Hara hachi bun me (腹八分目) and try to emulate it by stopping eating when I am no longer hungry rather than full. Stop at the first sigh is my mantra. I still eat junk food occasionally and not super strict with my diet as I want this to be my lifestyle forever. 
I've tried every diet going and I can’t maintain any weight loss.

I exercise 1-3x per week weight training and I golf at weekends, although I have a very sedentary job.

I had minimal side effects but I've been on it so long now. Maybe the first 3 months I had some nausea and stomach issues but I am also trying to heal gastritis and have post gallbladder removal issues (gallbladder came out in 2020 and was pre wegovy) so its hard to tell who is responsible!

Start weight: 216lbs BMI 30 Jan 2022
Currently: 163lbs BMI 22.7 
My goal weight was 157lbs but I am happy here.

I buy wegovy privately in the UK, and I didn't diet. Now the food noise is gone I try to eat intuitively. I love the Japanese eating principle Hara hachi bun me (腹八分目) and try to emulate it by stopping eating when I am no longer hungry rather than full. Stop at the first sigh is my mantra. I still eat junk food occasionally and not super strict with my diet as I want this to be my lifestyle forever. 
I've tried every diet going and I can’t maintain any weight loss.

I exercise 1-3x per week weight training and I golf at weekends, although I have a very sedentary job.

I had minimal side effects but I've been on it so long now. Maybe the first 3 months I had some nausea and stomach issues but I am also trying to heal gastritis and have post gallbladder removal issues (gallbladder came out in 2020 and was pre wegovy) so its hard to tell who is responsible! 

If you are also a slow loser or at the beginning of your journey, then I hope this helps and have patience! Its taken nearly 2 years to get here.",slow loser give want share progress slow loser moderate amount lose give hope need much amazing progress sub different body type start point slow loser feel like work please quit also shamelessly really pleased outside partner good friend one know wegovy also discuss weight publicly personal reason believe body deserve acceptance regardless size hence show lose total take year rate dress size stat female white british year old start weight bmi jan currently bmi goal weight happy buy wegovy privately diet food noise try eat intuitively love japanese eat principle hara hachi bun try emulate stop eat long hungry rather full stop first sigh mantra still eat junk food occasionally super strict diet want lifestyle forever try every diet maintain weight loss exercise per weight training golf weekend although sedentary job minimal side effect long maybe first nausea stomach issue also try heal gastritis post gallbladder removal issue gallbladder come pre wegovy hard tell responsible also slow loser beginning journey hope help patience take nearly year get,"['slow', 'loser', 'give', 'want', 'share', 'progress', 'slow', 'loser', 'moderate', 'amount', 'lose', 'give', 'hope', 'need', 'much', 'amazing', 'progress', 'sub', 'different', 'body', 'type', 'start', 'point', 'slow', 'loser', 'feel', 'like', 'work', 'please', 'quit', 'also', 'shamelessly', 'really', 'pleased', 'outside', 'partner', 'good', 'friend', 'one', 'know', 'wegovy', 'also', 'discuss', 'weight', 'publicly', 'personal', 'reason', 'believe', 'body', 'deserve', 'acceptance', 'regardless', 'size', 'hence', 'show', 'lose', 'total', 'take', 'year', 'rate', 'dress', 'size', 'stat', 'female', 'white', 'british', 'year', 'old', 'start', 'weight', 'bmi', 'jan', 'currently', 'bmi', 'goal', 'weight', 'happy', 'buy', 'wegovy', 'privately', 'diet', 'food', 'noise', 'try', 'eat', 'intuitively', 'love', 'japanese', 'eat', 'principle', 'hara', 'hachi', 'bun', 'try', 'emulate', 'stop', 'eat', 'long', 'hungry', 'rather', 'full', 'stop', 'first', 'sigh', 'mantra', 'still', 'eat', 'junk', 'food', 'occasionally', 'super', 'strict', 'diet', 'want', 'lifestyle', 'forever', 'try', 'every', 'diet', 'maintain', 'weight', 'loss', 'exercise', 'per', 'weight', 'training', 'golf', 'weekend', 'although', 'sedentary', 'job', 'minimal', 'side', 'effect', 'long', 'maybe', 'first', 'nausea', 'stomach', 'issue', 'also', 'try', 'heal', 'gastritis', 'post', 'gallbladder', 'removal', 'issue', 'gallbladder', 'come', 'pre', 'wegovy', 'hard', 'tell', 'responsible', 'also', 'slow', 'loser', 'beginning', 'journey', 'hope', 'help', 'patience', 'take', 'nearly', 'year', 'get']",167,post,1gbpp8g

1hkxmlc,titsmgee1977,"""You're wasting away!""","I am overwhelmed all of a sudden by the ""noticing"" effect. 

I'm 43 down this week. Everyone is noticing. Everyone. Like. ""You're wasting away"" is something I hear daily. 

Thing is, I'm just a healthier weight and they have only known me when I was heavy and that's it. 

One person asked me how much I have left to lose. I remarked that I'm not sure, that I will see how I feel as I go. I don't have the same body I did when I was thinner as I've had three kids and I'm older, so I don't know what my ""goal weight"" really is. I set it at 155 (I'm 180 now) so there is still a bit to go. They were like, ""OMG you will disappear!"" 

Overreacting much? Jesus. I had to explain that I have two autoimmune diseases and I can't have weight on my joints if I want to save them. Like, I'm getting healthy and now I'm being told it's too much. 

Like, what do you know about my health struggles? Oh, and when I explain that I've had pretty crappy side effects, like the nausea and vomiting sometimes, people then are like ""whoa, that's extreme! You will develop an eating disorder!"" Like, bi*ch why you do think I'm doing this in the first place?!

I just hit the ""overweight"" bmi and I am so proud of myself. And while these people are proud of me too and I know they mean well, it's starting to grate on my nerves. 

Just keeping ignoring it and keep moving. It's all I can do. I kind of like telling them about my joint damage and that I was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis at 17 and now I have to save my joints, because then they feel bad and shut up. Thank god I'm done with the holiday parties, because as excited as I was to dress up and FEEL good, the attention on my body ""wasting away"" has been too much. 

Luckily I have a great support system. So cheers to the good ones and cheers to all of you for ""wasting away"".

Struggled with my weight and dieting my whole life, finally decided to make big changes now that I turned 30. Wegovy has been a complete game changer!!!

Started by seeing a nutritionist last year. Jan 12, 2025 started 0.25mg wegovy with immediate results. Feb 2025 upped to 0.5mg wegovy. Mar 2025 went up to 1mg wegovy, and still on this dose although the food noise is starting to come back. Doc says to maintain with 1mg for a bit and then start weening myself off. 

My progress is 100% due to diet; I made no exercise changes. Once I got to 1mg I started getting sick from anything unhealthy. I was also very tired so I couldn’t bring myself to exercise much. Now the nausea and exhaustion are gone and I find my stomach, arms and legs have some loose skin, so I’m switching my focus to exercise. 

Interesting things I noticed during this process:
- Mothers were the first to notice changes! My grandma noticed when I was only 7 lbs down. Moms I work with commented at 15 lbs down. Men didn’t comment until I was 40 lbs down, and it was men who also struggle with their weight first, then the fitness bros that were proud of me.
- Growing up, all the early 2000s movies had skinny girls that thought they were fat. As a result, they always told us not to weigh ourselves every day, that we’ll develop an eating disorder and end up in the hospital. But this was the opposite advice of what I needed…I realized I always think I look great and the same even as I’m gaining too much weight for my frame. I guess I have the opposite of body dysmorphia? And I mentally explain away increasing sizes, blaming style changes or needing more room for my boobs. So I learned I need to weigh myself daily so I can peg myself to reality. Does anyone else feel like this??
- My feet went down a half size, and I had to shorten my necklace and watch chains. Didn’t expect that!
- It’s so much easier to shop now. It makes me sad that clothing companies don’t make bigger size clothing in the flattering fits for curvy girls. Everyone should be able to buy clothes that fit right. The exception is bras, they’re actually harder to find in my new size! 
- Wegovy isn’t cheap, but buying a whole new wardrobe was more expensive!!!

1o25l1n,JennWithTwoN,Slow Responders Unite! GIVE. IT. TIME.,"I started my WL journey back in September of 2022. I began using Saxenda and paying for it out of pocket. While I am fortunate enough to have great insurance, all WL medications were deemed a 'plan exclusion'. Long story short, I was purchasing from Canada and while it was cheaper than just getting it from a local pharmacy, I never went higher than the middle dose due to the price, which was still insanely expensive (also due to the Canada Post strike, I stopped taking Saxenda for about a month or so and would even skip weeks to make the pens last longer).

I made the switch to Amble and started my semaglutide journey in February of this year. I struggled with others I knew taking these meds who lost at a RAPID speed, while I seemingly puttered along. Eventually, I told myself to be grateful for any loss at all and more importantly, keeping it off.

GIVE. IT. TIME. I started my WL journey back in September of 2022. I began using Saxenda and paying for it out of pocket. While I am fortunate enough to have great insurance, all WL medications were deemed a 'plan exclusion'. Long story short, I was purchasing from Canada and while it was cheaper than just getting it from a local pharmacy, I never went higher than the middle dose due to the price, which was still insanely expensive (also due to the Canada Post strike, I stopped taking Saxenda for about a month or so and would even skip weeks to make the pens last longer).

I made the switch to Amble and started my semaglutide journey in February of this year. I struggled with others I knew taking these meds who lost at a RAPID speed, while I seemingly puttered along. Eventually, I told myself to be grateful for any loss at all and more importantly, keeping it off.

**The general guide you need to start your weight loss journey that answers most questions people put on here: Attempt 2!**

&#x200B;

**KEY NOTES if you don't wanna read it all.**

**--------------------**

&#x200B;

**It’s all about having** ***a healthy calorie deficit applicable to your activity*** **if you want to lose weight.**

SCALES ARE NOT THE END ALL AND BE ALL OF WEIGHT LOSS!

**Work out your TDEE for your calories and be realistic about your activity. Less than 10km distance walked/traveled/moved around each day is a sedentary lifestyle. Keep that in mind when saying how much you workout if you do.**

SCALES ARE NOT THE END ALL AND BE ALL OF WEIGHT LOSS!

**The times of day/night you eat doesn’t matter.**

SCALES ARE NOT THE END ALL AND BE ALL OF WEIGHT LOSS!

**Taking body measurements and a photo journal is a must. Have one photo in just underwear and one in with an outfit on. Sometimes your critical eye will not see what actually changed where the outfit will.**

SCALES ARE NOT THE END ALL AND BE ALL OF WEIGHT LOSS!

**You don't have to exercise to lose weight but it helps a hell of a lot.**

SCALES ARE NOT THE END ALL AND BE ALL OF WEIGHT LOSS!

**Just move! Whatever exercise that you will do regularly is good exercise. But be aware doing yoga everyday won't burn the same as a CrossFit class.**

SCALES ARE NOT THE END ALL AND BE ALL OF WEIGHT LOSS!

**This process takes a long time and if you are not consistent in you efforts then don't expect a change**.

SCALES ARE NOT THE END ALL AND BE ALL OF WEIGHT LOSS! **They measure you gravity to the ground. That's it. There are other factors of changing body composition that are far more important and a end goal weight isn't a bad thing but shouldn't be gospel to how well you have done so far.**

&#x200B;

Now to the long winded stuff!

**--------------------**

**CALORIES**

**--------------------**

To lose weight it is a very simple principle of energy expenditure. You must expend more than you consume and that's it, a simple calorie deficit. Do that correctly and you will lose weight. Even if you suffer with something like PCOS it will work. Sometimes I noticed with clients is that it worked but was slower but it wasn't an excuse for it not to work.

&#x200B;

For an adult I recommend 250-500 calorie deficit of your maintenance calories. for 12-16 year olds I recommend no more than 150-200 calories as they are still growing so a small deficit is better for them and increasing a kids physical activity can a lot of the time be all that's needed for children with no deficit added at all.

A slow weight  loss is usually a sign of good weight loss where good habits are being  ingrained into your life and you have a healthy calorie deficit so for the average person going over 500 calorie deficit is pretty pointless and usually not sustainable with the exception of a doctor's recommendation or you are a bodybuilder.

Now if you are morbidly obese you may likely need to do a bigger deficit than 500 calories  of what you normally eat but I would advise you to calculate your calories for maintenance then compare it to the calories to what you have been eating so far and bring it down to maintenance calories first for 2-4 weeks as you adapt to a healthier level of calories before adding a deficit as well. Typically most people I helped were eating to excess of 2000 calories plus of what they should've been eating just to maintain their current weight.

&#x200B;

**--------------------**

**Calculating Calories**

**--------------------**

[https://tdeecalculator.net](https://tdeecalculator.net/) is my recommended calculator for this. Its not perfect but as calculators go it does the job reliably enough to be the one I recommend.

Your  Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE) is an estimation of how many  calories you burn per day with exercise is taken into account. It is  calculated by first figuring out your Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR which is  basically the calories your body requires to function healthily), then  multiplying that value by an activity multiplier.

Since  your BMR represents how many calories your body burns when at rest, it  is necessary to adjust the numbers upwards to account for the calories  you burn during the day. This is true even for those with a sedentary  lifestyle.

&#x200B;

Don’t freak out that they are higher than what you expect, remember slow steady weight loss is best.

&#x200B;

When choosing your activity levels, my personal belief (and how I was taught) is that if you don't travel 10km a day (i.e. you have covered 10km with your feet walking in some format that isn't exercise) then your general activity is sedentary. So if you don't cover that distance drop your activity by one level as you may workout 6 times a week (heavy exercise) but if you sit on your butt all day in an office job then a moderate exercise choice is probably wiser.

&#x200B;

With any calculation the more info you put in it, the more accurate it will be. So with that in mind if you are able to put your body fat percentage in, the calorie suggestion will be more accurate for you.

For preferred methods of measuring body fat, I like the 9 point caliper test but you do need someone that knows how to do it or it will not be very accurate and even then if they do know how to it  properly there is a +/-3% variable even still. I do not recommend bio-electrical impedance as it can vary widely depending on your body shape (think pear shaped people) and your hydration. I take my Fitbit aria with a massive pinch of salt and wait every 4 weeks when I can see my mate that knows how to do the 9 point test.

I wouldn't worry too much on figuring your body fat percentage out though as how your general body composition is as you go along is more important and whether it is changing for the better.

For kids (12-16yrs) don't worry about measuring it at all unless a doctor has requested to be aware of it specifically.

&#x200B;

**If you use a calculator to workout your TDEE then do not follow your fitness tracker.**

TDEE takes your daily life and exercise you do into equation so you don't have add ""exercise calories"" to your allowance as that has been done already, so keep to your TDEE not your trackers.

&#x200B;

**Also be aware that as you lose weight you will need to re-check your TDEE.**

If you lose 2-3kg that can be enough to need to re-work your TDEE so do be aware of that if your weight loss slows or plateaus.

&#x200B;

**--------------------**

**How to track what you eat?**

**--------------------**

These days the main two apps/websites are MyFitnessPal & Loseit. Both are good and regularly corrected and updated. I personally use MyFitnessspal myself.

It's quite simple log in what you eat (preferably at the time of eating so you remember it properly or when you food prep it) and I mean **everything** including that biscuit one of your work colleges offered you in passing.

&#x200B;

Also be aware of logging liquid calories as well. If you drink a lot of smoothies, cordial, fruit juices, soda or coffee. Milk and sugar are still calories (especially if you like lattes) so make sure these logged in as well as so many times you ""eat well"" but all those liquids are ruining your progress.

I have genuinely had past clients change nothing to their food apart from drop all drinks apart from water and lose 2-4 kg in a month so please look at everything that goes in you.

&#x200B;

In conjunction of using one of the apps you will need a good set of scales (preferably digital in my opinion) as if you don't accurately put in what you eat, then there is a high chance of you over eating and not being in a proper deficit. If you don't accurately log what you eat then you can't ever say you are being accurate with your diet. Studies have shown time and time again we as people underestimate what we eat greatly.

&#x200B;

I would not trust portion sizes of packaging that well as 99.9% of the time they don't match what has been put in the packet for example a plain wrap could say 62g a wrap (187 calories) on the packaging  but end up being a 72g serving so be 224 calories. Not a lot of difference (35 calories) but it can build up over multiple meals easily. 3 meals over a day x 35 =105 calories and that can be the difference of real changes especially of your planned deficit is only 250 calories.

&#x200B;

There are some communities that say that tracking food causes eating disorders but the realistic truth is that if you don't keep track of what you eat in some way with reasonable accuracy, the chances are you will overeat and not lose weight. That is not the fault of diet culture or anything like that, it is your responsibility.

&#x200B;

Once you have a pretty sensible diet that is working for you and gotten used to it and know it inside and out then you can start to eyeball your portions as no one wants to be stuck to a scale each time they cook forever **but** I recommend doing this with high volume low calorie foods or if you have an object that you use and will know within a reasonable amount of accuracy it will be that amount.

I have a tiny measuring jug that i can do portions of rice or pasta and I know what level is going to be right +/- 5g uncooked but I also admittedly allow for that inaccuracy in my diet and have an assumption any eyeballing is always the overestimate to cover myself and stop any disappointments.

&#x200B;

**--------------------**

**Diet**

**--------------------**

&#x200B;

**I can't iterate enough that the one that you can sustain is the best diet!**

&#x200B;

It honestly doesn't matter if you follow slimmers world, keto, intermittent fasting (I kinda do this one) or anything thing else as like I said before if you are in a deficit you will lose weight.

A healthy balanced diet is preferable but not wholly necessary when it comes to losing weight but again recommended.

Personally  I think the best thing for your food is once you have your calories  worked out is to use a macro break. That’s the breakdown of how much  protein, fats and carbs you eat (apps can track that for you). If adding this seems overly complicated and feel too much then don't bother with it but I do think it is a good idea to do especially if trying to some form of exercise to 'tone' your physique.

I  would go for a 40% Protein, 40% Fats and 20% Carbs as a break. Protein  and fats help you feel fuller for longer and generally more satisfied  when eaten. Protein also helps keep your muscle mass while losing  weight (that is a bit bro science but also kinda true) especially if exercising regularly.

I  for the most part make sure I eat my quota of protein and don’t worry  too much about the break of fats and carbs as long as I hit my calorie  goal. Admittedly though I always  feel the most satisfied when I keep to the macro break stated.

I used to fast 19-20 hours a day and re-feed over 5-4 hours but with my girlfriend and her little one that doesn't really work well and though quite often I don't eat what they eat (they're vegetarian and I was told to never be one but that's another story) I like to be able to sit, eat and chat with them at the dinner table instead of sit there like a pleb or away on the sofa. so typically now I'll have a small lunch, biggish evening meal and snack a little while after. It a rough version of intermittent fasting but it works for me.

A dietitian I met had a cool chat with me and he said to add this to my guide to clear some things up and

“I could tell you to eat this or that and don’t eat this or that which, is kinda my job to do. But at the end of the day all I do is make a food plan that puts them on a calorie plan to lose weight, maintain weight or gain weight depending on what you medically need (deals with a lot of NHS work).

In a perfect world I’d tell you to never eat bacon as it’s pretty bad for you but it’s f\*\*king delicious and so I know you’re gonna eat it too like me but if you eat 2 slices of it a week, it won’t kill you. A little of everything is fine and excess of anything is bad. Stop over complicating it, eat meat, veggies, fruit, nuts, fat, carbs, protein and junk. Just not a lot of one thing. Oh and stay hydrated, so many times people moan about being hungry all the dam time and they’re just dehydrated.”

&#x200B;

**I don’t know what to eat for my calorie bracket and/or macro**

&#x200B;

[https://www.eatthismuch.com](https://www.eatthismuch.com/) – for recipe help. Its fairly good and you can choose the amount of meals you want as well as snacks and it will come up with ideas as well. It even lets you get rid of foods you don't like mushrooms and choose diet plans like keto etc to help you as much as possible and as far as I'm aware still free.

&#x200B;

Again I am not a dietician so I cannot say to you what to eat so please ask a government body registered dietician for something like that. Otherwise the link above has pretty good reviews with my peers and old clients.

**SCALES AND WEIGHT LOSS MEASUREMENT**

**--------------------**

&#x200B;

**SCALES ARE NOT THE END ALL AND BE ALL OF WEIGHT LOSS!**

&#x200B;

They really aren't, they are a good guide to **help show** a downward trend but do not dictate your successes or failures of you and how well you are doing.

Scales are the equipment that measures your relation to the earth's gravity that forever make us cry ourselves to sleep. Use them with a pinch of salt please I beg you.

Don’t aim to lose a  certain amount each week. Just aim to lose and accept it’s not a temporary measure it’s a lifestyle change and going to take a long time.  Accept that, plan for the long term and screw beach body ready crap.

&#x200B;

Along with scales I recommend taking a photo in just your underwear and also a photo in one particular outfit as well as taking body measurements with a tape measure.

[This youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9ZnioXCRhU) is old and cheesy but explains how to use a tape measure pretty well but ignore the calipers section as that's pretty naff.

&#x200B;

With how regular you take measurements, I would recommend going on the scales and taking a photo of yourself in your underwear once a week at the same time of day and the same day each week as if you stand on the scales repeatedly throughout day you will find your weight fluctuates so much in 24 hours.

&#x200B;

As for taking measurements with a tape measure and photo with your selected outfit I would recommend taking them every 2-4 weeks but try to always keep the intervals the same for consistency.

Ladies  your natural cycle can affect your weight greatly (you probably already  know this) so try not to forget it if the scales mess you around a bit.

**SPEED OF WEIGHT LOSS**

**--------------------**

It is unfortunate but the truth is weight loss is not fast at the best of times and plateaus are often so strap in for a long haul. Some weeks will be 1kg loss, some 0.5kg and sometimes even a 100g (which will barely register on most scales) but you have to remember it is still a downward trend no matter how small.

If things are plateauing don't freak out, breathe and look at what you have been doing during the plateau.

1. Look at your past measurements and photos and see how you have changed (especially from the beginning).
2. Look at how well you have been eating or how accurately you have been tracking what you have been eating as a common issue is your eyeballing skills have been off on regular foods you have been eating.
3. Has your physical activity dropped as of late? Life and work can get in the way sometimes and you need to re-evaluate your TDEE temporally while your activity is lower.
4. Or the one good cause for a plateau is that since you have lost weight and your TDEE has dropped because of this. This can be the most common reason as when you lose weight (2-3kg) your TDEE will drop and it's normal. Weight loss is a fluid thing and so are your calories, be aware and adapt as necessary.

&#x200B;

**--------------------**

**Exercise**

**--------------------**

To be honest do what exercise **you enjoy and will do regularly.** This is the most important thing about exercise as if you don't enjoy it 90% of the time, then you won't keep it up. It's as simple as that. Just be aware that yoga won't burn as much as a crossfit class.

&#x200B;

Now if you are stuck for ideas of what to do, here are some simple circuits you can do that don't require a lot of space. I would advise making sure you are warmed up before you do any exercise.

I recommend doing [this](https://darebee.com/workouts/quick-warmup-workout.html) followed by [this one](https://darebee.com/workouts/4-minute-warmup-workout.html) as they are quick, easy and get the job done (I recommend darebee for workout ideas in general if you're ever stuck for what to do).

The following 4 workouts are pretty simple and follow the same format:

Try to do 10 circuits with 1-2 mins rest between circuits. It doesn't matter if you can only do a couple of circuits at the start just do what you can do.

&#x200B;

**Workout 1**

|Exercise|REPS|
|:-|:-|
|Squat|15|
|Reverse Lunge|16|
|Press Up|15|
|Tricep Dip (off a chair or similar stable object)|15|

|Plank Hold|60 secs|

&#x200B;

**Workout 2**

|Jump Squat|15|
|Tricep Dip (off a chair or similar stable object)|15|
|Walking Lunges|16|
|Sprint on the spot|30 secs|

&#x200B;

With any exercise please look each up properly and make sure you know how to do it properly. Don't be afraid to make an exercise easier (or harder) if need be.

&#x200B;

After any workout you should make sure you cool down and stretch properly [this should be enough](https://darebee.com/workouts/top-to-bottom-workout.html) to cover most muscle groups.

&#x200B;

**--------------------**

**Supplements?**

**--------------------**

Long story short, you don't need them. Some protein powder to help you get the protein quota and a good multi vit but keep it to that.

&#x200B;

Fat burners, fat metabolizors, fat removers are all crap. If it says it will help you burn fat, chances are it will be a waste of your money and you will be better off spending it elsewhere.

&#x200B;

When it comes to supplements I don't have much more to say on it to be honest. I don't think there is a need to go much more into them than that. Unless you are training for something specific don't bother to look into them unless you have a trainer that you use personally to advise you otherwise or ask some of the nutrition or supplement reddits here for more info.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**KEY NOTES if you don't wanna read it all.**

**--------------------**

&#x200B;

**It’s all about having** ***a healthy calorie deficit applicable to your activity*** **if you want to lose weight.**

SCALES ARE NOT THE END ALL AND BE ALL OF WEIGHT LOSS!

**Work out your TDEE for your calories and be realistic about your activity. Less than 10km distance walked/traveled/moved around each day is a sedentary lifestyle. Keep that in mind when saying how much you workout if you do.**

SCALES ARE NOT THE END ALL AND BE ALL OF WEIGHT LOSS!

**The times of day/night you eat doesn’t matter.**

SCALES ARE NOT THE END ALL AND BE ALL OF WEIGHT LOSS!

**Taking body measurements and a photo journal is a must. Have one photo in just underwear and one in with an outfit on. Sometimes your critical eye will not see what actually changed where the outfit will.**

SCALES ARE NOT THE END ALL AND BE ALL OF WEIGHT LOSS!

**You don't have to exercise to lose weight but it helps a hell of a lot.**

SCALES ARE NOT THE END ALL AND BE ALL OF WEIGHT LOSS!

**Just move! Whatever exercise that you will do regularly is good exercise. But be aware doing yoga everyday won't burn the same as a CrossFit class.**

SCALES ARE NOT THE END ALL AND BE ALL OF WEIGHT LOSS!

**This process takes a long time and if you are not consistent in you efforts then don't expect a change**.

SCALES ARE NOT THE END ALL AND BE ALL OF WEIGHT LOSS! **They measure you gravity to the ground. That's it. There are other factors of changing body composition that are far more important and a end goal weight isn't a bad thing but shouldn't be gospel to how well you have done so far.**

&#x200B;

Now to the long winded stuff!

**--------------------**

**CALORIES**

**--------------------**

To lose weight it is a very simple principle of energy expenditure. You must expend more than you consume and that's it, a simple calorie deficit. Do that correctly and you will lose weight. Even if you suffer with something like PCOS it will work. Sometimes I noticed with clients is that it worked but was slower but it wasn't an excuse for it not to work.

&#x200B;

For an adult I recommend 250-500 calorie deficit of your maintenance calories. for 12-16 year olds I recommend no more than 150-200 calories as they are still growing so a small deficit is better for them and increasing a kids physical activity can a lot of the time be all that's needed for children with no deficit added at all.

A slow weight  loss is usually a sign of good weight loss where good habits are being  ingrained into your life and you have a healthy calorie deficit so for the average person going over 500 calorie deficit is pretty pointless and usually not sustainable with the exception of a doctor's recommendation or you are a bodybuilder.

Now if you are morbidly obese you may likely need to do a bigger deficit than 500 calories  of what you normally eat but I would advise you to calculate your calories for maintenance then compare it to the calories to what you have been eating so far and bring it down to maintenance calories first for 2-4 weeks as you adapt to a healthier level of calories before adding a deficit as well. Typically most people I helped were eating to excess of 2000 calories plus of what they should've been eating just to maintain their current weight.

&#x200B;

**--------------------**

**Calculating Calories**

**--------------------**

[https://tdeecalculator.net](https://tdeecalculator.net/) is my recommended calculator for this. Its not perfect but as calculators go it does the job reliably enough to be the one I recommend.

Your  Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE) is an estimation of how many  calories you burn per day with exercise is taken into account. It is  calculated by first figuring out your Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR which is  basically the calories your body requires to function healthily), then  multiplying that value by an activity multiplier.

Since  your BMR represents how many calories your body burns when at rest, it  is necessary to adjust the numbers upwards to account for the calories  you burn during the day. This is true even for those with a sedentary  lifestyle.

&#x200B;

Don’t freak out that they are higher than what you expect, remember slow steady weight loss is best.

&#x200B;

When choosing your activity levels, my personal belief (and how I was taught) is that if you don't travel 10km a day (i.e. you have covered 10km with your feet walking in some format that isn't exercise) then your general activity is sedentary. So if you don't cover that distance drop your activity by one level as you may workout 6 times a week (heavy exercise) but if you sit on your butt all day in an office job then a moderate exercise choice is probably wiser.

&#x200B;

With any calculation the more info you put in it, the more accurate it will be. So with that in mind if you are able to put your body fat percentage in, the calorie suggestion will be more accurate for you.

For preferred methods of measuring body fat, I like the 9 point caliper test but you do need someone that knows how to do it or it will not be very accurate and even then if they do know how to it  properly there is a +/-3% variable even still. I do not recommend bio-electrical impedance as it can vary widely depending on your body shape (think pear shaped people) and your hydration. I take my Fitbit aria with a massive pinch of salt and wait every 4 weeks when I can see my mate that knows how to do the 9 point test.

I wouldn't worry too much on figuring your body fat percentage out though as how your general body composition is as you go along is more important and whether it is changing for the better.

For kids (12-16yrs) don't worry about measuring it at all unless a doctor has requested to be aware of it specifically.

&#x200B;

**If you use a calculator to workout your TDEE then do not follow your fitness tracker.**

TDEE takes your daily life and exercise you do into equation so you don't have add ""exercise calories"" to your allowance as that has been done already, so keep to your TDEE not your trackers.

&#x200B;

**Also be aware that as you lose weight you will need to re-check your TDEE.**

If you lose 2-3kg that can be enough to need to re-work your TDEE so do be aware of that if your weight loss slows or plateaus.

&#x200B;

**--------------------**

**How to track what you eat?**

**--------------------**

These days the main two apps/websites are MyFitnessPal & Loseit. Both are good and regularly corrected and updated. I personally use MyFitnessspal myself.

It's quite simple log in what you eat (preferably at the time of eating so you remember it properly or when you food prep it) and I mean **everything** including that biscuit one of your work colleges offered you in passing.

&#x200B;

Also be aware of logging liquid calories as well. If you drink a lot of smoothies, cordial, fruit juices, soda or coffee. Milk and sugar are still calories (especially if you like lattes) so make sure these logged in as well as so many times you ""eat well"" but all those liquids are ruining your progress.

I have genuinely had past clients change nothing to their food apart from drop all drinks apart from water and lose 2-4 kg in a month so please look at everything that goes in you.

&#x200B;

In conjunction of using one of the apps you will need a good set of scales (preferably digital in my opinion) as if you don't accurately put in what you eat, then there is a high chance of you over eating and not being in a proper deficit. If you don't accurately log what you eat then you can't ever say you are being accurate with your diet. Studies have shown time and time again we as people underestimate what we eat greatly.

&#x200B;

I would not trust portion sizes of packaging that well as 99.9% of the time they don't match what has been put in the packet for example a plain wrap could say 62g a wrap (187 calories) on the packaging  but end up being a 72g serving so be 224 calories. Not a lot of difference (35 calories) but it can build up over multiple meals easily. 3 meals over a day x 35 =105 calories and that can be the difference of real changes especially of your planned deficit is only 250 calories.

&#x200B;

There are some communities that say that tracking food causes eating disorders but the realistic truth is that if you don't keep track of what you eat in some way with reasonable accuracy, the chances are you will overeat and not lose weight. That is not the fault of diet culture or anything like that, it is your responsibility.

&#x200B;

Once you have a pretty sensible diet that is working for you and gotten used to it and know it inside and out then you can start to eyeball your portions as no one wants to be stuck to a scale each time they cook forever **but** I recommend doing this with high volume low calorie foods or if you have an object that you use and will know within a reasonable amount of accuracy it will be that amount.

I have a tiny measuring jug that i can do portions of rice or pasta and I know what level is going to be right +/- 5g uncooked but I also admittedly allow for that inaccuracy in my diet and have an assumption any eyeballing is always the overestimate to cover myself and stop any disappointments.

&#x200B;

**--------------------**

**Diet**

**--------------------**

&#x200B;

**I can't iterate enough that the one that you can sustain is the best diet!**

&#x200B;

It honestly doesn't matter if you follow slimmers world, keto, intermittent fasting (I kinda do this one) or anything thing else as like I said before if you are in a deficit you will lose weight.

A healthy balanced diet is preferable but not wholly necessary when it comes to losing weight but again recommended.

Personally  I think the best thing for your food is once you have your calories  worked out is to use a macro break. That’s the breakdown of how much  protein, fats and carbs you eat (apps can track that for you). If adding this seems overly complicated and feel too much then don't bother with it but I do think it is a good idea to do especially if trying to some form of exercise to 'tone' your physique.

I  would go for a 40% Protein, 40% Fats and 20% Carbs as a break. Protein  and fats help you feel fuller for longer and generally more satisfied  when eaten. Protein also helps keep your muscle mass while losing  weight (that is a bit bro science but also kinda true) especially if exercising regularly.

I  for the most part make sure I eat my quota of protein and don’t worry  too much about the break of fats and carbs as long as I hit my calorie  goal. Admittedly though I always  feel the most satisfied when I keep to the macro break stated.

I used to fast 19-20 hours a day and re-feed over 5-4 hours but with my girlfriend and her little one that doesn't really work well and though quite often I don't eat what they eat (they're vegetarian and I was told to never be one but that's another story) I like to be able to sit, eat and chat with them at the dinner table instead of sit there like a pleb or away on the sofa. so typically now I'll have a small lunch, biggish evening meal and snack a little while after. It a rough version of intermittent fasting but it works for me.

A dietitian I met had a cool chat with me and he said to add this to my guide to clear some things up and

“I could tell you to eat this or that and don’t eat this or that which, is kinda my job to do. But at the end of the day all I do is make a food plan that puts them on a calorie plan to lose weight, maintain weight or gain weight depending on what you medically need (deals with a lot of NHS work).

In a perfect world I’d tell you to never eat bacon as it’s pretty bad for you but it’s f\*\*king delicious and so I know you’re gonna eat it too like me but if you eat 2 slices of it a week, it won’t kill you. A little of everything is fine and excess of anything is bad. Stop over complicating it, eat meat, veggies, fruit, nuts, fat, carbs, protein and junk. Just not a lot of one thing. Oh and stay hydrated, so many times people moan about being hungry all the dam time and they’re just dehydrated.”

&#x200B;

**--------------------**

**I don’t know what to eat for my calorie bracket and/or macro**

**--------------------**

&#x200B;

[https://www.eatthismuch.com](https://www.eatthismuch.com/) – for recipe help. Its fairly good and you can choose the amount of meals you want as well as snacks and it will come up with ideas as well. It even lets you get rid of foods you don't like mushrooms and choose diet plans like keto etc to help you as much as possible and as far as I'm aware still free.

&#x200B;

Again I am not a dietician so I cannot say to you what to eat so please ask a government body registered dietician for something like that. Otherwise the link above has pretty good reviews with my peers and old clients.

**SCALES AND WEIGHT LOSS MEASUREMENT**

**--------------------**

&#x200B;

**SCALES ARE NOT THE END ALL AND BE ALL OF WEIGHT LOSS!**

&#x200B;

They really aren't, they are a good guide to **help show** a downward trend but do not dictate your successes or failures of you and how well you are doing.

Scales are the equipment that measures your relation to the earth's gravity that forever make us cry ourselves to sleep. Use them with a pinch of salt please I beg you.

Don’t aim to lose a  certain amount each week. Just aim to lose and accept it’s not a temporary measure it’s a lifestyle change and going to take a long time.  Accept that, plan for the long term and screw beach body ready crap.

&#x200B;

Along with scales I recommend taking a photo in just your underwear and also a photo in one particular outfit as well as taking body measurements with a tape measure.

[This youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9ZnioXCRhU) is old and cheesy but explains how to use a tape measure pretty well but ignore the calipers section as that's pretty naff.

gis03c,keto_kween_,The size small Zara shirt,"I sit on the floor by my closet as I write this. Five years ago I saw the cutest shirt at Zara — it has pink lace and small ruffles and it’s very “me.” They only had a size small left and I bought it. At that time I was about 190 pounds standing 5’2. I was no where near a size small. I told myself, as I so often did, that I will lose weight and fit into this shirt one day. The next year my friend was over at my house and looking through my clothes as we were getting ready to go out. I was about 200 pounds and I could not find anything descent to wear. This was a constant struggle. Outfit choices weren’t about fashion or what would look stylish — it was about what would hide the fat the most and not be terribly uncomfortable. As my friend was helping me find something to wear, she came across the shirt and said, “why do you have this - and it still has the tag on it!” I told her I bought it because one day I will fit into it. She told me to stop buying clothes that don’t fit me because it’s a waste, and said if I’m not using them I should just let her wear them so someone can use them. 

For the past couple years every time I would look through my closet and see the shirt, tucked all the way in the back, I would  run my fingers over the lace trim, and say “one day — one day I will fit into this shirt.”

kmt0jp,[deleted],180 lb weight loss. Here's what worked for me and what didnt.,"I made myself pretty sick listening to the typical weight loss advice so I'm writing this post to tell everyone what worked, what didn't and why. Along with some advice.

1. See your doctor and get a health profile first. If I had done this, I would have known I had low blood pressure. I therefore would not have listened to people who told me to reduce my salt intake and drink only water. I almost died so, take it from me: reducing salt with low BP is... not awesome.

2. Self test for food allergies. Method 1: Treat yourself like a baby, start with easy to process foods and add back one food a week. Reduce or eliminate foods that give you stomach pain, bloating, or an allergic reaction. Method 2: Every week (or 2 weeks), eliminate a food or food type. Look for for reduced bloating or weight loss, and look for stomach pain etc when you add it back. That's how I found out I was allergic to wheat. And why I got tested for celiac. I lost a TON of the weight just from stopping the allergic reactions.

3. Don't guzzle drinks. If you're so thirsty you need to knock back an entire bottle of water, you're too thirsy. Drinking that fast causes stomach pain, which in turn makes you want to avoid water. Drink lots throughout the day to stay hydrated.

4. Drinks aren't food lubricant. Your body is mostly water, and it needs water more often than most people drink it. If you're just having a glass (or a liter, hello McDonald's cup) of liquid with every meal, you're not drinking enough (or in the case of a big takeout cup, you're drinking too much)

5. Avoid high fructose corn syrup. That's all I have to say about that.

6. Avoid artificial sweeteners. They tend to taste sweeter than sugar and you can accidentally normalize sugar to your system.

7. Reset your tastebuds. Do a detox. I drank nothing but black tea and water for 3 days to cleanse my system and my palate. Most of us are way too used to extremely high sugar content in food. Because of that, we think foods like fruit are extremely bland. Once you reset your palate you can easily develop a normal relationship with sugar. Things like apples and strawberries will taste as sweet as cakes and pies. You'll eat less junk without even thinking about it.

8. Choose snacks by texture. Train your brain to say ""I want chips... I want something crunchy... I want carrot sticks"" ""I want chocolate... I want something smooth and sweet... I want blueberries""

9. Eat lots of soup.

10. Don't over eat Fibre or foods your body can't process. This was one of my worst mistakes. I spent more time on the toilet... it was bad. A lot of diets are going to tell you to mainline lettuce or peas, or just go feral on corn. If you do... You're going to poop a lot. Now granted, the average person has about 3-8 lbs of poop in their intestine. And granted, you can get a lot of reading done on the toilet, but you've got places to be. Things to do. You need to live!

11. Don't eat useless greens. Is my hatred for lettuce showing? Look, the world is full of lettuces. You've got spinach, which gives you an iron boost. Kale and bok choy, the nutrient powerhouses. Collard greens and Swiss chard, those love muffins of magnesium and calcium and potassium. Lettuce is like... Solid water with Metamucil mixed in. Stick some Swiss chard on your burger. Fry up some collards or bok. Live a little.

12. Nothing green has any calories. Except avocadoes. Avocadoes have a million calories and a zillion grams of fat and taste like troll snot, except in guacamole. Mint chip ice cream has no calories however, because it is green. Fite me. 

13. Drink. But don't DAH-RINK. A glass of wine or a few cocktails can relax you after a long day, and reduced stress is a good thing. Some alcohol has positive effects: red wine has antioxidants, vodka sterilizes, bourbon can alleviate cold symptoms. And most alcohol loosens your joints which is good for ongoing health and probably why your alcoholic granny lived to be 97 BUT drinking too much fills you with extra calories and lowers your inhibitions. Or, as my forever tipsy prof once put it: ""for every one drink you think you drunk, you drank 3 drinks you didn't think you drunk, and that's why you don't think you drunk.""

14. Smoking is bad for your cardio. So is air pollution. I don't smoke, and I lost 40 of those pounds by moving out of a place where  I lived with a smoker and into a town with better air quality. I started swimming or running at the gym instead of outside. Basically, if you cant breathe, your workouts will be shorter, because you need oxygen to survive.

15. Sports. Basically, swimming for an hour burns 400 ish calories. Running burns 300 or so. But swimming lengths or running in circles for 60 full minutes is boring, painful, and misery making. Some people love running, I'm sure they exist. Great for them. I hate running. But can I run for an hour during a 2 hour game of baseball or soccer? How many times do I squat during a volleyball game? And how many tricep pullbacks do I do on a leisurely canoe trip across the lake? I'm not counting... And I'm doing more than I would have just staring at a wall watching it.... wall, or whatever. 

16. Do it now. Don't waste time on ""I wish I could"" Wish you could go to the beach? Go. Wish you could wear a crop top? Do. I had an irrational fear that everyone would hate, scream at, and make fun of me. OK not completely irrational. That's what they did in high school. And some high school kids did it when I started just wearing the bikini as an adult. But a lot more people complimented me, or didn't notice at all. I was just a person. Not a big old ugly spectacle with a neon ""hate me"" sign taped to my forehead. 

17. Don't catfish. Put your whole self on your profiles.  Not close ups of your face. Get professional photos taken in an outfit you absolutely love, and own it. 

18. Take care of yourself now. ""I'll get my hair cut when I'm skinny."" ""I'll buy new clothes when I'm skinny"" ""I'll love myself when I'm skinny."" get the haircut now. 

19. Dab on the haters. Or do some other, similarly weird as hell gesture. When people made fun of me, I would sprinkle glitter on them. ""Every time it rains glitter on an asshole, somewhere, a fairy gets its wings"" The looks on their faces were honestly priceless. They'd either look shocked, get angry, or laugh and think I'm awesome. Either way I won. Full disclosure: someone did try to punch me once. That day, I was pretty glad for all the cardio. 

20. Sleep is very important. That's what I want you to tell people when they catch you passing out after your yoga stretch routine at the park. Don't forget to thank them for the coffee money.

Here's what worked for me and what didnt. I made myself pretty sick listening to the typical weight loss advice so I'm writing this post to tell everyone what worked, what didn't and why. Along with some advice.

1. See your doctor and get a health profile first. If I had done this, I would have known I had low blood pressure. I therefore would not have listened to people who told me to reduce my salt intake and drink only water. I almost died so, take it from me: reducing salt with low BP is... not awesome.

2. Self test for food allergies. Method 1: Treat yourself like a baby, start with easy to process foods and add back one food a week. Reduce or eliminate foods that give you stomach pain, bloating, or an allergic reaction. Method 2: Every week (or 2 weeks), eliminate a food or food type. Look for for reduced bloating or weight loss, and look for stomach pain etc when you add it back. That's how I found out I was allergic to wheat. And why I got tested for celiac. I lost a TON of the weight just from stopping the allergic reactions.

3. Don't guzzle drinks. If you're so thirsty you need to knock back an entire bottle of water, you're too thirsy. Drinking that fast causes stomach pain, which in turn makes you want to avoid water. Drink lots throughout the day to stay hydrated.

gz4u6j,fooliojones11,"If you want to lose weight effectively, read this.","  

I’m a 20-year-old male who has been active my whole life. I played three sports in high school and would lift weights 5 times a week. I’ve weighed around 220-230 for the past 4 years until this year. I started my weight loss journey in January and as of today, I am 175 pounds and am slightly stronger than I was at 220-230. 

I’m telling you all this because I’ve seen so many young kids on this reddit page and I want to give them good advice that works. 

FIRST. You can run 10 miles a day, but if you come home and eat a box of doughnuts, you WILL NOT lose weight. Weight loss is 95% diet and 5% working out. The first thing you should do is look up your TDEE and set your activity level as sedentary. Your TDEE is the amount of calories you burn every day by just being alive. This number is NOT 100% accurate!!! It is simply an estimate. If you want to lose 1 lb a week, eat 500 less calories, if you want to lose 2 lbs a week, eat 1000 less calories. Now, you can add the amount of calories that you burn while working out, but just know that fitbits and apple watches will GREATLY overestimate the amount of calories you are burning. My recommendation is to simply guess and check. Let’s say your TDEE is 2000 calories and you think you will burn about 250 a day. This means that if you eat 2250 calories a day, you will stay the same weight. I would eat 500-1000 less calories for about 2 weeks and if you lose anywhere form 1-2 lbs a week, you’re estimate is pretty good. If you aren’t losing any weight, you are eating too much and need to lower your calorie intake. REMEMBER, your weight will fluctuate EVERY SINGLE DAY, so be sure to look at weekly trends and make sure that your weight is trending down over the course of two weeks or so. 

SECOND. Download an app such as MyFitnessPal and TRACK YOUR CALORIES!!!! Everything you eat you should be tracking. If you do this, you know exactly how many calories you are eating and can hold yourself accountable.

THIRD. DON’T DRINK YOUR CALORIES. Never ever drink your calories if you are trying to lose weight. Do you know how filling a glass of juice or milk is? Not very. If you can cut out liquid calories, you will save yourself so many calories that you can put towards food instead. DRINK WATER!!!!! Drink tons and tons of water and when you aren’t thirsty anymore, drink some more. A lot of times you aren’t really hungry and by drinking water, you can satisfy some cravings. You don’t need to quit soda cold turkey! Switch to diet soda it’s ok!!!! Sure, diet soda isn’t as good for you as water, but guess what, it has 0 calories!!!! You don’t need to drink 12 diet dews a day, but if you can’t get over soda, just switch to diet.

FOURTH. Eat low calories dense foods. What do I mean by this? 85 grams of spinach is about 20 calories while there are 450 calories in 85 grams of peanuts. You need to find foods that have low amounts of calories per gram. NOBODY IS GETTING FAT OFF OF SPINACH!!!! If you like salads, eat them all the time. CUT THE DRESSINGS/SAUCES. Do you know how many calories are in 2 tablespoons of ranch? 140!!! DO NOT waste calories on high calorie dressings/sauces. You can find dressing/sauces that are low in calories and this is essential in losing weight. Some examples of low calorie dense foods are spinach, lettuce, chicken breasts, egg whites, most vegetables, and lean turkey. Eat 4-5 meals a day if you can. Make sure these meals are relatively low in calorie and the total calories between them add up to the amount you have set for yourself. If you can spread out your meals, you can satisfy your cravings more often. Also, eat lots of protein and fiber as those tend to fill you up and make you ""full"".

FIFTH. Macros do not matter that much. Eat carbs and fats if you want. All of weight loss is being in a calorie deficit. Hell, if you want to lose weight eating McDonalds every day, you could if you tracked your calories and ate very little of it. Obviously you shouldn’t do this, but I’m just trying to show that you will lose weight if you burn more calories than you eat. 

SIXTH. It’s okay to have a bad day. I didn’t follow my diet to a tee every single day and I still lost a lot of weight. The important thing is to limit the amount of bad days you have and to not lot one cheat day turn into two. STAY CONSISTENT!!!

Finally. Weight loss is all on YOU. YOU CAN DO THIS! Don’t expect to lose 30 pounds in a month. Be consistent with it and try to change your diet for the better so when you are done losing weight, you have a healthy and sustainable diet that you can follow for the rest of your life and keep the weight off.

I’m a 20-year-old male who has been active my whole life. I played three sports in high school and would lift weights 5 times a week. I’ve weighed around 220-230 for the past 4 years until this year. I started my weight loss journey in January and as of today, I am 175 pounds and am slightly stronger than I was at 220-230. 

I’m telling you all this because I’ve seen so many young kids on this reddit page and I want to give them good advice that works. 

FIRST. You can run 10 miles a day, but if you come home and eat a box of doughnuts, you WILL NOT lose weight. Weight loss is 95% diet and 5% working out. The first thing you should do is look up your TDEE and set your activity level as sedentary. Your TDEE is the amount of calories you burn every day by just being alive. This number is NOT 100% accurate!!! It is simply an estimate. If you want to lose 1 lb a week, eat 500 less calories, if you want to lose 2 lbs a week, eat 1000 less calories. Now, you can add the amount of calories that you burn while working out, but just know that fitbits and apple watches will GREATLY overestimate the amount of calories you are burning. My recommendation is to simply guess and check. Let’s say your TDEE is 2000 calories and you think you will burn about 250 a day. This means that if you eat 2250 calories a day, you will stay the same weight.

1l0w1vg,jessicaeatseggs,A tip I learned from the Simpsons that is so far working.,"""Eat a bell pepper!""

The episode where Homer is losing weight and his trainer keeps telling him to eat a bell pepper if he's hungry. Obviously we cannot survive off of peppers alone, but when I'm feeling snackish and know I don't need any food and want to avoid junk, I tell myself ""Eat a bell pepper!"" and I cut one up and eat it. 

I also know of someone who lost a lot of weight and used to get fast food a lot. They started keeping a bag of apples in their car and snacking on apples instead of getting the fast food, and it worked. 

I also snack on apples when snackish but not hungry. I find it's handy to cut the apple up rather than biting into it bc it makes me feel more bougie.  I also just feel so healthy eating an apple a day, I really do recommend.

km48dx,ReachWinter7344,Let me tell y’all how I lost my weight... 🍿,"
I was tired of just being “cute for a big girl.” I wanted to be attractive. I tried so many times to get the weight off but it never worked. I never stuck with it. I couldn’t figure out why it was so hard for me to be disciplined. I wasn’t into the fast fixes like liposuction or tummy tucks. I knew I’d have to exercise to reach my goal. Until, I realized that I was trying to reach a goal to appease other people more than myself. I knew I liked food so I took the process slow. Went at my own pace, and to the beat of my own drum. 

First, I started wearing clothes my size. I had a bad habit of buying smaller clothing like it would magically make me look smaller to the world.  I got rid of all the polka dots, strips and black  garments I’d wear to appear thinner. I bought clothing ((((I)))) thought was cute, and that (((((I )))) felt comfortable wearing. Clothing I did not have to pull or tug at to make fit. It wasn’t a secret that I was a big girl and I needed to embrace or change it. PERIOD! 

Then, I tackled my insecurities. I hated my arms with a passion, and the fat that would swing under them as I waved to people from afar. I didn’t wear sleeveless shirts, and I barely wore T-shirt’s because I was just to self conscious about my “wings.” I use to joke and tell people that Red Bull Gave me wings. (Lol) So they knew that I knew about my wings. Smh. 
One morning I woke up, brushed my teeth and stared at myself naked in the mirror. I told myself, “ fuck it, love it,” and I flapped my wings like a bird and kissed them. I looked at my post baby droopy stomach. I caressed it. I told myself that my stomach was beautiful and that my stretch marks were just my children’s autograph. I named it my bacon egg and cheese because my stretch marks reminded me of bacon for some odd reason. It makes people laugh till this day. I’m comfortable with it. I looked at my thighs, grabbed them, and I yelled “ cell-u-like it!!!!!! To myself in the mirror making myself laugh. I thought to myself, this is me and will always be me unless I choose to change it. (I still do my mirror ritual to this day)
The day came when I was out riding the bus, I was extremely hungry. It felt as if my stomach and back were having a conversation. When I got off the bus I had the Opportunity to go get food but this new, fuck it, love it - me, didn’t want any food because I didn’t want to feel bloated, Uncomfortable, and to full in my cute ass outfit. I remember thinking ... OMG. I actually think Im cute today! I really felt good about myself! So much, that I felt I was to good for a hamburger y’all. I was soooo proud that day. I was determined to feel that good about myself everyday. I started experimenting with food portions to see how small of a portion I could eat, and still be satisfied. I paid attention to the foods I ate and the effects they had on my body. What foods caused bloating, a heavy menstrual ( greasy food for me) etc. That’s how my weight loss journey began. 

I found exercising boring so I made a play list of all my favorite twerking songs and danced till they were all done and I was drenched in sweat. I swept instead of vacuuming, used the stairs instead of an elevator, I’d take the stairs two at a time, I curled gallons of milk while waiting to check out in the grocery store, I’d do a squat after picking up each toy left on my living room floor, I’d run to get the mail and run back. I started out small but the changes I started to see were big. Soon, I started to feel to cute for a lot of things. Like eating unhealthy food that would ruin all my work and how I felt about myself, the people who were never interested but all of a sudden were, the “ you don’t have to lose weight, I like you the way you are” - people, the un-encouraging people. I felt to good to stay stuck in the past, to not get out and go places. I felt good enough to stay disciplined and stick to what was now my goal.

1it2gh5,Simple_Condition4066,skinny people really don't eat much,"Just getting into my skinny habits, and one thing i realized is they are around like in a  200-300 deficit through out the week, so when they overindulge they don't gain any weight.

And they eat healthy, a little salad here and there with protein, small sweet treat, they don't finish their plate when they are full.

It's just blows my mind, all my life i had to finish my food even when i wasn't hungry, so i instantly finished everything all the time even when i didn't want it.

1lsv36s,my80lbs_journey,I lost 80 lbs and I’m not done yet. Here’s what actually helped me when nothing else ever worked.,"I’ve been overweight most of my life. Tried everything. Keto, fasting, weight watchers, gym plans I never stuck with, even pills at one point. Nothing ever really lasted more than a few weeks. I’d lose 10 lbs then gain 15 back. Over and over. I hated the cycle and honestly, I hated myself most days.

Then one day I just said screw it, I’ll stop trying to be perfect and just do something small. I started walking. Just 20 minutes a day. Not fast, not pretty, just moving. I didn’t even think of it as a workout. I just wanted to clear my head. That’s all I did for the first couple weeks.

Then I cut soda. That was huge. I didn’t realize how much I was drinking until I stopped. After that, I slowly changed my meals. I didn’t count calories but I ate more real food. Eggs, chicken, rice, veggies. Nothing fancy. I still had junk sometimes but less of it.

Biggest thing? I stopped quitting every time I messed up. Like yeah, I had bad days. I overate sometimes. But I didn’t throw the whole week away over one bad meal. That mindset shift is what helped me most. I used to be all or nothing. Now I just aim for better, not perfect.

It took me about 10 months to lose 80 lbs. No gym, no crazy diet. Just small stuff I could stick to. I still got more to go but I feel like a whole different person. Mentally and physically.

If you're in that place where you feel stuck or like nothing works for you… just start small. Walk. Drink water. Sleep better. Eat real food when you can. It adds up. It really does.

1n3b0cb,Physical_Artist_7773,Lost 165 lbs over 2 years. Here's what actually worked (and the mistakes that almost derailed me),"**Lost 165 lbs over 2 years. Here's what actually worked (and the mistakes that almost derailed me)**

I'm writing this because I wish someone had told me these things when I started. There's so much conflicting advice out there, and I made every mistake in the book before figuring out what actually works.

**Track your weight daily, but don't obsess over daily numbers.** This was huge for me. I used to step on the scale and either celebrate or have a mental breakdown based on that single number. Your weight fluctuates 2-5 pounds daily just from water, food timing, and a million other factors. What matters is the trend over weeks, not the daily drama. I found this app on app store called WeightyAI that basically became my sanity saver - it has this AI check-up button that takes all your weight logs and tells you if you're actually on track despite the daily ups and downs, and even gives you exact calorie adjustments when you get off track. Game changer for staying on track. 

**Stop drinking your calories.** I was consuming like 800 calories a day in ""healthy"" smoothies, fancy coffee drinks, and orange juice. Liquid calories don't make you feel full the same way. Switched to mostly water, black coffee, and the occasional diet soda. Lost 15 pounds in the first month just from this.

**Meal prep is overrated, food prep is underrated.** Everyone talks about spending Sundays making 20 identical chicken and rice containers. I tried it, hated it, gave up. Instead, I prep ingredients: wash and cut vegetables, cook a big batch of protein, make some grains. Then I can throw together different combinations throughout the week without eating the same sad meal five times.

**Your hunger signals are broken (at first).** When you're used to eating 3000+ calories, 1800 feels like starvation even though it's plenty. It takes about 3-4 weeks for your hunger cues to recalibrate. Push through those first few weeks - it genuinely gets easier.

**Cardio is not the answer.** I spent months doing hours of cardio and wondering why I looked ""skinny fat."" Started lifting weights and everything changed. You don't need to become a powerlifter, but some resistance training will make you look and feel so much better as you lose weight.

**Plan for plateaus.** Everyone hits them. I'd go 3-4 weeks with zero change on the scale and want to quit. That's when having something that could analyze my progress objectively was crucial - it would tell me I was still on track and maybe just needed to drop calories by 100 or increase my walking. Having that guidance instead of guessing kept me from making dramatic changes or giving up.

**Social eating is the final boss.** I could stick to my plan perfectly at home, then one dinner with friends would derail me for days. Had to learn that I could enjoy social meals without going completely off the rails. One big meal won't ruin your progress, but the guilt spiral afterward might.

**Take progress photos and measurements.** The scale lies, especially when you're building muscle. I have photos where I'm the same weight but look completely different. Measure your waist, arms, whatever matters to you.

**Sleep matters more than you think.** When I was getting 5-6 hours, I was constantly hungry and craving junk. Started prioritizing 7-8 hours and my appetite regulated itself. Plus I had energy for workouts.

**Find your ""why"" that goes deeper than looks.** Mine was being able to keep up with my kids and not feeling winded going up stairs. When motivation wavered, that kept me going more than wanting to look good in photos.

**Stop making it complicated.** Eat mostly whole foods, stay in a reasonable calorie deficit, move your body regularly, be patient. That's literally it. All the other stuff is just noise.

The biggest thing I learned? This isn't about perfection, it's about consistency. I probably ""messed up"" my plan 2-3 times a week for two years straight. But I kept coming back to it, and that made all the difference.

Hope this helps someone avoid some of the mistakes I made.

**Cardio is not the answer.** I spent months doing hours of cardio and wondering why I looked ""skinny fat."" Started lifting weights and everything changed. You don't need to become a powerlifter, but some resistance training will make you look and feel so much better as you lose weight.

**Plan for plateaus.** Everyone hits them. I'd go 3-4 weeks with zero change on the scale and want to quit. That's when having something that could analyze my progress objectively was crucial - it would tell me I was still on track and maybe just needed to drop calories by 100 or increase my walking. Having that guidance instead of guessing kept me from making dramatic changes or giving up.

**Social eating is the final boss.** I could stick to my plan perfectly at home, then one dinner with friends would derail me for days. Had to learn that I could enjoy social meals without going completely off the rails. One big meal won't ruin your progress, but the guilt spiral afterward might.

**Take progress photos and measurements.** The scale lies, especially when you're building muscle. I have photos where I'm the same weight but look completely different. Measure your waist, arms, whatever matters to you.

**Sleep matters more than you think.** When I was getting 5-6 hours, I was constantly hungry and craving junk. Started prioritizing 7-8 hours and my appetite regulated itself. Plus I had energy for workouts.

**Find your ""why"" that goes deeper than looks.** Mine was being able to keep up with my kids and not feeling winded going up stairs. When motivation wavered, that kept me going more than wanting to look good in photos.

**Stop making it complicated.** Eat mostly whole foods, stay in a reasonable calorie deficit, move your body regularly, be patient. That's literally it. All the other stuff is just noise.

The biggest thing I learned? This isn't about perfection, it's about consistency. I probably ""messed up"" my plan 2-3 times a week for two years straight. But I kept coming back to it, and that made all the difference.

Hope this helps someone avoid some of the mistakes I made.

1ji38a4,delete_all_tokens,The simple way I lost 90 lbs in 5 months,"Hello, if you’re reading this you may also be struggling with your weight. I know there’s a million posts everywhere of how to lose weight and you pull your hair out trying to compare which is correct. I think this over complicates the matter.

Instead of focusing on people telling you “the best way to do it,” focus on yourself and your habits. Your mind is self sufficient, if you have any sort of basic education, you don’t need more than that.

I am very lazy. I would never have been able to accomplish these goals if I was following someone else’s plan. In order to lose fat, there are some basic things to know, and then you just live your life moving forward with these things in the back of your head:

1. Salads with every meal are the #1 way to keep calories low. If you do a protein source + a salad, you will feel full long term.

2. If you want to be in a calorie deficit everyday, find a way to eat two meals instead of three. I am a glutton. I cannot eat a meal with barely anything on the plate. If you can try, drink a black coffee instead of a meal. Caffeine suppresses appetite and it’s 0 calories.

3. Foods that are worth the calories don’t come out of a box. Boxed food is formulated by scientists to give you most bang (calories) for the buck (bites). Don’t trust packaged food that says it’s healthy (it’s not). Healthy and balanced food is grown out of the ground, or eats something grown out of the ground. Food from nature is naturally balanced. For instance, a carb dense food contains a lot of fiber in nature. Not BS boxed food. This topic pisses me off, if you can’t tell, sorry for the rant.

4. Walk. It is so easy, if you don’t have a disability of course. You don’t need to exercise crazy if you are morbidly obese like I was. Walk everyday. Start with 20 mins, then 30 mins, then go an hour. Find any excuse to walk, park far away from the store and walk the extra distance. The thing is, we want simple things we can do and not stress over them. You can walk everyday. It’s not hard, and it feels good, both physically and mentally. Most of your weight loss will come from food, but going on hour long walks( which can be broken up) will add a little extra boost. Do you watch tv or podcasts at home on the couch? You can do that while walking too, and might as well, for your general health.

And that’s it: salads, skip meals w/ coffee, natural food, walking. Paired with the knowledge that everyone’s body will lose fat if you spend more energy just being alive than you eat everyday, you can do it. 

Weight loss is not easy, but it is simple. Especially if you’re obese, by eating less you’re conditioning your body to run off stored fat. By walking you’re boosting this process. 

Get into a routine, then focus on your work or what’s important; not food. The more you can not focus on food, the easier it will be to lose weight and not think about it.

I’m not an expert, just a guy that learned basic things and used it to turn his life around. Hope this helps.

ko7mdr,[deleted],Observation: losing weight involves a whole lot of sitting around and not eating (and doing nothing becomes your best weight loss friend),"Seriously —

It’s a weirdly simple way of describing it, but it’s true.

I mean sure, you’re doing other stuff in the meantime *instead* of eating:

Going to work, watching a film, going for a stroll,

even a full workout once in a while to help things along a little bit more —

But the bulk of losing weight,

90% of the whole process,

is literally just **doing nothing**.

Thing is though...

I absolutely **loooove** doing nothing 😍😍😍

As a chronic overthinker,

 It’s my favourite thing to do 😃

And so, a proverb is born:

‘Weight loss begins where one’s love of **doing nothing/doing other things** in response to stress outweighs one’s former love of **eating** in response to stress.’ 

So now, 

whereas food used to be my go-to stress relief, 

Going to a room and just being on my phone and chilling out until the stress passes is now my go-to,

And it’s really helping so far,

And it’s having this incidental r/CICO effect which is nice.

People say ‘it’s 90% food’,

but it’s actually **90% mental**. 

You gotta frame your weightloss in a way that makes sense to you personally,

And that’s how the ‘forever habits’ of the permanently new you really stick and fully take effect.

Update: whoa this really blew up! Thank you for all your super inspiring comments saying you’ll give this framing a go, and for all the advice in the comments too. To help I thoughts I’d provide a bullet list of ‘other stuff to do/stuff to do while doing nothing’:

• Sorting through emails on your phone

• Tidying photos (deleting duplicates/blurry pics) on your phone 

• Social media scrolling if that’s your thing

• Watching Netflix/Prime/Binge/Disney Plus/Apple Plus

• Surfing YouTube (video essays, etc)

• Catching up on email/message replies

• Editing/Updating your IMDb Watchlist

• If you’re an entertainment scholar like me, watch video game lore videos (hehe)

Notice how none of these involve any physical activity? That’s what I’m talking about! Embrace TRUE laziness, friends!

1jr29zj,SnooSketches293,I lost 46 lbs...Let me help you!,"I very seldom write on Reddit (check my stats) but I want to offer some guidance in hopes it'll help someone (or two). 

It all began on a crispy fall night in November 2019....(let me stop). Anyway, I ran into my best friend's mom who I've known for 20+ years and haven't seen for about 3 - and she didn't recognize me. The look on her face brought defeat through my then 191 lb. body. I remember running to my car and sobbing - you would have thought someone died. And yes, someone did. That version of me. I gained 35 lbs and apparently became unrecognizable. And I mean I knew it right? I was showering and finding a new back roll in the shower, my clothes didn't fit, I kept calling my stomach ""bloated"" and my love for sweets were at an all time high. I had the body shape of Spongebob - not very lady like I must say. I hated that this was the situation (or should I say MY situation) but I knew I would have to experience some level of defeat or embarrassment to get a hold over my lack of discipline and my constant excuses. Now let's cut to the facts...here's what I implemented and I hope this helps at least someone who's at their wits end: 

1. This advice should take up the first 2 slots but **FOOD ISN'T GOING ANYWHERE**. The bad shit that you love whether it's sweets, fast food, carbs etc. will always be there. **Food is not something that goes out of style.** You know what it tastes like, how it makes you feel and most importantly - where it's gotten you. Eat the bad shit later. You can always make or buy it later. This is the #1 tip I would give to anyone. Yes the cravings kick in, you see it, smell it, you get a frustrated, you want it but guess what? You experienced it before so you're not missing out on having it again. It's also not that you can never have bad food...you just can't have it YET. Remember, the ""not yet"". I remember eating grilled chicken, broccoli and a sweet potato and saying out loud ""this mac and cheese is amazing...YUM"". Delusional? Yes. Eating healthier food? YES. 

2. Eat high volume foods that have lower calories. **Homemade Cava bowls made me feel like I was eating chipotle.** I would load it up with kale, brown rice, sweet potatoes, veggies, etc. And since I was doing so much chewing, I felt so much more full. Fooled myself into a filling healthy alternative. 

3. **WALK and track it.** Whether it's with a walking pad, outdoors, treadmill...just walk. Move your body. We all walk everyday so make it a personal competition to get to your desired amount per day and if you have friends you know that are in the same boat or want to support you, get a little competitive. Whoever gets the most steps at the end of the week has to treat the other to a small gift. Little incentives will surely bring you some spark and make you want to keep going. 

4. Don't drink your calories. Water and diet coke are my besties - and don't let me add a lemon on the side. Now it's a party. If you want to treat yourself to some wine or a drink from time to time, go for it. **Don't deprive yourself to a point where you feel you aren't living.** 

5. And lastly, give a fuck. No seriously. **Give a fuck about what you look and feel like**. Look in the mirror and say to yourself ""**I need to be better to YOU**"" while pointing. It's not vain, arrogant or misleading. You have to care about you and do things that may be uncomfortable for you, for now. Don't sit around and envy those who have the body, mentality or discipline that you desire. Choose your hard and if you don't like your current hard, willpower is created about what you do or won't do.

zh5uxk,ApprehensiveBit4182,Things I’ve learned after losing 100lbs,"SW: 298 CW: 198 GW:170

- You can’t outrun 🏃🏾 a bad diet (Believe me I’ve tried lol)

- One day does not ruin your progress no matter how bad you may have binged. Pick yourself up and keep going. 

- The scale ⚖️ isn’t the only measure of progress. 

- Nobody’s opinion matters when it comes to this journey. You have to be selfish. (Family/friends saying you’re “losing too much weight” 🙄)

- There are no “bad” foods. There’s nutritious foods and non-nutritious foods. Balance and moderation is key. 

- The best workout is the workout you enjoy doing. You’re more likely to see success with that because you’ll stick to it. So once again nobody’s opinion matters. Do what works for you. 

- Rest days are as important as activity days. 

- If you’re not at your goal, don’t spend too much on clothing. 🤣 buy what you need for the time being.

- Detox products are a pile of 💩 stay away from that garbage. Most of them are simply laxatives that will dehydrate you. 

- Do not rely on motivation. Rely on discipline. I’m rarely motivated lol but self-discipline helps with progress. 

- Finally, it’s a marathon not a sprint. Losing it is the easy part. Keeping it off is the difficult part.

Clarification on the point about clothing:

I didn’t say don’t buy ANY clothes at all. I just said don’t break the bank for it if you’re not at your goal.

klkbu3,Boatwhistle,An unexpected and hilarious effect of losing 120 lbs.,"Since I started losing weight I got nothing but encouragement from thin people. However in the past month more and more people in my every day are picking on me about it. They mock me by saying in an intentionally moronic voice ""oh wait this has calories!"" before eating something I wouldn't. They do this sort of thing regardless of me keeping to myself, and fact is that I keep my diet to myself unless asked otherwise. These little jabs just keep happening randomly and it has all been so out of nowhere and from every part of life.

I have come to realize two things from all this. Firstly, I have been dieting for so long that the act of doing so has become apart of my identity so I am heavily associated with anything relevant to nutrition and exercise.  Secondly all the people picking on me have a common denominator, they are all people that used to be thinner then me but are now fatter then me. It may make me an asshole, but I couldn't help but smile upon realizing this. You see, I am used to being jealous, not the one others are jealous of. I gotta say, it is a good feeling.

I am not going to be a jerk about it, I'll just keep it to myself day to day. However it does excite me as this is a very honest perception of others opinions. When someone says something nice about your fat loss, it could be partially a lie or exaggeration in order to motivate you. However when people start being a little mean out of jealously, now that is earnest.

1l3d0ig,Little_GingerbreadG,I lost over 100lbs. Here’s some of what I do if anyone wants to hear,"Ok I’m not at my target weight completely yet. I went from 320-280lbs and I’m currently at 176lbs. I am 20f 5’5. 

My main thing was walking. I don’t drive so I started walking so much anyways after I moved out of my parents house. Also biking. I’m from a southern state so it gets really hot in the summers, ofc I had to work so that never stopped me I sweat bucket loads. 

I drink mainly water/coffee. I will have a coke or soda from time to time. One cup of coffee a few days a week ( I don’t drink coffee everyday but often). And if I am in the mood for something other than water I usually do sweet tea or just a Gatorade. Overall though, water is my best friend. 

I still eat what I want, but I’ve always been a salad/veggie person bc I grew up around a garden. I try to just do portion control. I won’t promote this part but I don’t usually eat three meals a day (I don’t like breakfast food is why ) 

If I eat snacks I try to eat a smaller amount. Like for example I’m in the mood for some chips I’ll eat a little handful of the bag, then wait, maybe go back and another small handful. That way I can portion it I dont give myself all of it. 

I do struggle sometimes with motivation to workout, so I like to do high intensity. I do something that I can do fast pace, then stop for a little then start again. I don’t work out everyday but a few times a week I do probably about 20-30min. And of course a mix of walking and jogging regularly ! 

Motivation help: SUNLIGHT! even just going outside boost energy . VITAMINS! good for metabolism. WORKOUT VIDEOS! 

Also, stressing so much about how much weight you’re losing is gonna take a mental toll. Find something that feels good for you! You won’t see it all at once and it’s NOT HEALTHY to see any weight loss all at once. 

When I was at my biggest weight (320lb) I was depressed, and part of my weight loss was the discipline of making myself do something I didn’t want to do. I still even struggle with it, but changing small little things is bigger than you realize :)

1hxrccl,Z_C1,"I’ve Lost Over 40kg! Exercise Isn’t as Easy as It Sounds… But This One Tip Changed My Life!
","When I weighed 150kg, the advice I constantly received was: *“Go to the gym, start running, or try HIIT classes — they work wonders!”* As someone who had never exercised before, I thought, *“How hard could it be?”*

I was completely wrong.

I still remember my first HIIT class. Five minutes in, I was drenched in sweat, my face was bright red, and I was gasping for air. I physically couldn’t keep up and had no choice but to leave. The next day was even worse — the body aches were unbearable, like I’d been beaten with a stick.

So, I decided to try running instead. The same thing happened: I was out of breath in no time, and the aftermath was just as painful.

At that point, I started thinking something must be wrong with me. How could I not even exercise? Was I destined to stay obese and unhealthy for the rest of my life just because I couldn’t work out?

That’s when a friend gave me a piece of advice that changed everything: *“Start with walking.”*

I started small — just 10 minutes a day for a week. Then I gradually increased it to 20 minutes, then 30. Now, I walk 10,000 steps a day. Walking became my foundation for weight loss, helping me shed the kilos while slowly building my stamina and endurance.

If you’re at the beginning of your weight-loss journey, I highly recommend walking. It’s simple, manageable, and sustainable. Stick with it, take action, and you’ll start to see the fruits of your labor.",1175,81,2025-01-10T05:37:35,WeightLossAdvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/1hxrccl/ive_lost_over_40kg_exercise_isnt_as_easy_as_it/,1.0,True,/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/1hxrccl/ive_lost_over_40kg_exercise_isnt_as_easy_as_it/,2025-10-27T19:36:35.899542,"I’ve Lost Over 40kg!

rl3sod,stoler42,My Doctor Today: You’re now thin. You don’t have to lose anymore weight. 525lbs- 240lbs,"Today I went for [walking to the post office- now running a 5K](https://imgur.com/gallery/frmTx7P)

Today I went for my skin removal consultation. I’m down -175lbs over a 2 year period -285lbs over an 8 year period. I’m getting to the point where losing weight doesn’t make me feel like I look better. In my face, around my stomach and now legs- I’m starting to feel like I’m not improving- that I’m looking older and older.

I went in thinking the doctor would either laugh me out of the office- tell me to lose more weight and have me come back in six months. I thought this because well- that’s how most of my doctor’s office visits go. Today that changed. 

First thing out her mouth- I’m so proud of you- I nod and dodged the praise. “Yup- thanks” anyways- “how much weight do I need to lose to qualify to have this extra skin removed?”

“Did you not hear me?” The doctor replied. “You’ve done an amazing job- you’re so thin”

I almost turned my head to find the person she was talking to. Again- it’s not hitting me that the words she’s speaking are to me. 

“You look confused,” said the doctor. “Don’t you see how far you’ve come?”

I tilted my head down- “is she trying to sell me something?” I thought. “She must need to fill some sort of quota.”

“Ken”- (my name is Ken) “you don’t have to lose anymore weight.” 

I couldn’t dodge this one. Tears just flowed out of my eyes. Never has anyone called me thin- said I did a good job- nor has any medical professional ever said- “you don’t need to lose anymore weight” a deep sadness fell over me. “Am I done?” I wondered. I felt this wave of disbelief fall over me. “Did I finally make it to the top?”

She asked me why I was crying. I couldn’t begin to put into words the pile of explanations, short stories, or bitter memories that led to my reaction. 

There’s just too much. 

If I had to break it down to the most simple idea it would be this: I never thought I would make it here. 

Truthfully I didn’t think I would ever reach a point where a doctor was complementing me on my body. My body has always been a source of great grief. It’s been my one constant villain that I’m ultimately responsible for and yet could never muster up the strength, the will, nor the focus to keep chipping away at the weight that has weighed me down. I was never meant to succeed. I was never set up for success nor was I prepared to succeed. The weight of that conversation is utterly heavy. Never before have I felt so proud and so overwhelmed by positive news. 

I guess I now have to figure out what defines me- because in my mind, you are defined by the burdens you fight against every day. I’m not so naive that I think my fight is over. The fight will never be over.  But today was a victory that I will remember fondly.",1156,57,2021-12-21T07:55:11,WeightLossAdvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/rl3sod/my_doctor_today_youre_now_thin_you_dont_have_to/,1.0,True,/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/rl3sod/my_doctor_today_youre_now_thin_you_dont_have_to/,2025-10-27T19:36:38.074187,"My Doctor Today: You’re now thin.

1e04czc,mjh8212,I’m Shocked,"August of last year I weighed 275 pounds, I made an appointment with a bariatric surgeon for November. In November at the appointment I weighed 265. Dr told me to lose 5 pounds before surgery. 

I saw a dietician but since they were farther away I did video visits to check in. She’d go over my diet and see what I was eating and how much. I stepped on the scale and was 238 so I made an in person visit. I was weighed and we went over my diet adjusting a few things. Then I was told I no longer qualified for surgery, gastric bypass but i could try for the gastric sleeve. I decided not to do any surgery and dropped the program. 

I’d seen a therapist who helped me with grazing and binge eating which was very helpful now if I want to just eat I ask myself why and if it’s worth it. I used to eat a lot of sweets baked goods and pastries and I cut all that out just saying I’m going to do this so I didn’t eat them. I now don’t like what I ate before and my taste buds have changed. I also get full from small portions now so it’s impossible to binge eat. 

I just weighed myself as I do every week to two weeks and I’m 205. I’m 70 pounds down on mostly diet alone. I have chronic pain and mobility issues so exercise even walking isn’t doable most days.  I seriously thought I’d have surgery to be this weight. Now I just went through a box of used to be too small shirts and they all fit me. I went from a 3-4x 26 jeans to lg-xl and 18 jeans. It’s possible for everyone if I can do this anyone can I thought I’d never stop binge eating but my brain and willpower allowed me to. This is very much a mental thing as well. I may still be 205 but I feel so small.

ivszhc,[deleted],"PSA: Starvation mode isnt ""your body holding on to fat"" and also you dont have it.","I am very tired of people telling others on here that they are in starvation mode. 

Starvation mode is something that happens when you are ACTUALLY starving. When your body goes into starvation mode, it shuts down organs and functions it does not see as crucial at that moment, and because it now no longer has to maintain those functions, the body burns less calories in a set time period. This happens to people living in extreme poverty or have eating disorders. This is your body's last ditch effort to keep you alive and its why people with Anarexia often die of organ failure.

Starvation mode ISNT your body just deciding to ""hold on to fat"" because ""it doesnt know when you will eat next"". If our body was able to hold on to fat it would ALWAYS do that, because thats a great evolutionary trick.

1ffc1dh,Boatie1999,230 to 155: I lost 75 lbs in 12 months – Here are 10 foods I ate to lose it.,"Pictures aren’t allowed on this sub, so if you want to see my body transformation, go to my post on r/CICO  A few things to start – I heavily practiced CICO. In my opinion, CICO is law. It needs to be treated as objective truth. So, these are all foods I ate to help limit my caloric intake. You won’t see fruits or vegetables on this list. I feel like it’s obvious enough that fruits and vegetables are fantastic for you, you cannot eat enough of them, so I tried to pick food outside the obvious. For additional context I am 5’6” 25 yr old male. At the start of my journey, my calorie goal was to eat around 1,800 calories a day. I consistently adjusted as I lost weight, I now sit at about 1,500 a day. 

1. Dannon Light & Fit Nonfat Vanilla Greek Yogurt and Kashi Go Cinnamon Crisp Cereal – I ate these 2 things together nearly daily. The yogurt is 90 calories per 170g with 14g of protein and the cereal is 210 calories per 62g with 13g of protein. I’d make myself a bowl with 2 servings of yogurt, and about 40g of cereal. Total 315 calories with 36g of protein.

2. Potatoes: Sweet potatoes were my personal favorite, but I ate gold, red, and purple too. Russet and white are fine as well, I just like the others better. Potatoes are one of the most satiating foods on the planet, meaning you can eat a little but feel incredibly full. They are also rich in vitamin C, potassium, and fiber if you eat the skin. I would cut them into cubes, drizzle lightly with oil, season them, and roast them in the oven at 425°F for 20-30 minutes depending on how many were on the cookie sheet. Regardless of whatever potato you’re using, you can safely assume 100cal for every 100g.

3. Trader Joe’s Shawarma Chicken Thighs: My personal favorite dinner, they are so tender and flavorful. These come pre-seasoned and pre-marinated from TJ’s. Just toss them in the oven or on the grill and enjoy. 160 cals for 4oz of chicken. 5-6 oz is usually a decent enough serving for 200-260 calories. These can be high in sodium, but just get a good sweat for your next workout and you’ll be good.

4. Pork Tenderloin: Not my personal favorite but the macros on these are incredible. I don’t have a specific brand that I love but I’d generally buy the pre-marinated ones from Smithfield, Trader Joe’s, Aldi, and Jewel-Osco. Depending on what flavor you go with, these are generally 130-160 calories per 4oz of pork with 16-18g of protein. Typically for dinner, I’d eat 8oz of pork for 260-320 calories and that would get me 32-36g of protein. Same with the chicken thighs, these are high in sodium but just make sure you get a good sweat occasionally.

5. Zero Calorie/Zero Sugar sodas and water flavorings: Dude, when I tell you I chugged these. Definitely try to drink as much plain water as possible, but when it’s just not cutting it for you, it's more than okay to go for something like Crystal Light to add some fruit punch flavoring to your water. Diet sodas are fine too – people will tell you that diet soda is worse for you than regular soda. Fuck ‘em. At the end of the day, weight loss is a game of calories and diet sodas are 0 calories. Where people usually get in to trouble is drinking a diet soda might make them want some food to go with it. Manage that, and you’re golden.

6. Jimmy John’s: I ate so much Jimmy John’s, I might just be the new Jared from Subway minus the kid diddling. We have a Jimmy John’s in the lobby of my office building, so here’s the sandwiches I’d get for lunch. Regular #4 Turkey Tom on white, no mayonnaise, add cucumbers (extra), jimmy peppers (extra), onions (extra), pickles (extra), mustard, oil & vinegar, and oregano-basil. Total 380 calories. If I wanted a heartier sandwich I’d do the same thing just on a regular #14 Bootlegger Club on white. (no mayonnaise, add cucumbers (extra), jimmy peppers (extra), onions (extra), pickles (extra), mustard, oil & vinegar, and oregano-basil.) Total 580 calories. The main difference being the Bootlegger has 2x meat and they scoop out the bread on the Turkey Tom

7. Fat Free Cottage Cheese: Like the Greek yogurt, cottage cheese is a cheat code when it comes to macros. I would and very still just eat this directly out of the tub with a spoon. Taste and texture with cottage cheese can greatly vary, so my advice is just find a brand you like with good calorie count/protein and just stick to it. My personal favorite was Jewel-Osco’s in-house brand Lucerne Farms – 80 calories per 113g with 12g of protein. I also liked the Trader Joe’s fat free cottage cheese.

8. Quaker Rice Crisps: Most of the stuff on the list has been more substantial food, but sometimes you just wanna snack like no one’s looking. These have been my go-to guilty free snack. Depending on what flavor you pick (Apple Cinnamon, Caramel, and Cheddar are my personal favorites) they are generally 130-140 calories a serving, 3 servings in a bag. So you can eat the whole bag for \~400 calories, really good value imo for whenever you want to gorge. Quaker’s normal rice cakes are also good value, \~50 calories a cake, but I think the crisps are better tasting and more “chip-like” so I better satisfy that snacking feeling.

9. Outshine No Sugar Added Popsicles: These are the best diet popsicles out there, hands down. Outshine makes their popsicles with real fruit and juice so they’re more expensive than a value brand sugar free popsicles but it’s worth it, imo. 3 Outshine popsicles is only 80 calories – insane value. The number of times I’d sit in bed watching TV eating popsicle after popsicle. The artificial sweeteners have a tendency to make people gassy, I definitely got gassy, but I’ll take a few farts for only 80 calories.

10. Sugar Free/Lite Condiments and Dressings: People are often shocked to learn how many calories are in sauces and dressings so I opted for lots of sugar free/lite options. Here are my favorites: Sweet Baby Ray’s No Sugar Added BBQ sauces (any flavor) – 15cals for 32g. Ray’s does the best job imo of making sugar free BBQ sauces that are still thick and close to the original flavor. Any G Hughes sauce/marinade, these are all sugar free and usually 5-20 calories per 2 tablespoons. Kraft Lite dressings. Raspberry and Balsamic Vinaigrettes are my favorite. 30 cals per 2 tablespoons.

I hope this list helps in some form or fashion. The biggest thing is to do your best to stay disciplined. Discipline beats motivation when motivation is tired. Change won’t happen overnight, but over many nights. Work hard and stay at it – it will happen for you the way it happened for me.

My personal favorite was Jewel-Osco’s in-house brand Lucerne Farms – 80 calories per 113g with 12g of protein. I also liked the Trader Joe’s fat free cottage cheese.

8. Quaker Rice Crisps: Most of the stuff on the list has been more substantial food, but sometimes you just wanna snack like no one’s looking. These have been my go-to guilty free snack. Depending on what flavor you pick (Apple Cinnamon, Caramel, and Cheddar are my personal favorites) they are generally 130-140 calories a serving, 3 servings in a bag. So you can eat the whole bag for \~400 calories, really good value imo for whenever you want to gorge. Quaker’s normal rice cakes are also good value, \~50 calories a cake, but I think the crisps are better tasting and more “chip-like” so I better satisfy that snacking feeling.

9. Outshine No Sugar Added Popsicles: These are the best diet popsicles out there, hands down. Outshine makes their popsicles with real fruit and juice so they’re more expensive than a value brand sugar free popsicles but it’s worth it, imo. 3 Outshine popsicles is only 80 calories – insane value. The number of times I’d sit in bed watching TV eating popsicle after popsicle. The artificial sweeteners have a tendency to make people gassy, I definitely got gassy, but I’ll take a few farts for only 80 calories.

10. Sugar Free/Lite Condiments and Dressings: People are often shocked to learn how many calories are in sauces and dressings so I opted for lots of sugar free/lite options. Here are my favorites: Sweet Baby Ray’s No Sugar Added BBQ sauces (any flavor) – 15cals for 32g. Ray’s does the best job imo of making sugar free BBQ sauces that are still thick and close to the original flavor. Any G Hughes sauce/marinade, these are all sugar free and usually 5-20 calories per 2 tablespoons. Kraft Lite dressings. Raspberry and Balsamic Vinaigrettes are my favorite. 30 cals per 2 tablespoons.

I hope this list helps in some form or fashion. The biggest thing is to do your best to stay disciplined. Discipline beats motivation when motivation is tired. Change won’t happen overnight, but over many nights. Work hard and stay at it – it will happen for you the way it happened for me.

ulawme,Other-Ad-2810,I realized I had to thank my fat,"So I’ve been struggling with my kilos for almost ten years now, since an ex told me I had put on some weight and he didn’t want to touch me anymore. 

I had started putting on weight after being assaulted, but I had not realized that at the time.

Fast forward 10ish years of diet, depression and hating my body. I finally started healing. But I just couldn’t lose weight. Everytime I lost weight, something* (*edited) shifted inside of me and I just had to put it all back on. It felt like without the kilos I would die. 

And this weekend, I met with a girlfriend from school after 10ish years of not seeing each other (I realize the numbers just now…!!). At some point I said “I put on all this weight because, when I felt depressed, instead of jumping out the window or throwing myself under a bus, I ate.” and she replied “Damn. Thank God for these kilos, then!”

And it hit me.

For the first time in all those years and struggles and hating myself, I realize that my kilos actually saved me. I always thought eating had been a way of escaping and shutting down my emotions, but it actually was my own survival mechanism. I was saving myself and staying alive until I was strong enough to cope with it all. And to heal. And now I started healing for real. So I think I am finally ready to say goodbye to these kilos. But instead of saying “good riddance” I’m actually saying “Thank you”. I am at peace. And that is a huge deal. Because I’m not in a hurry of being skinny anymore. I am in owe of how strong I am. And I am damn proud of myself.

I wanted to share in case it would help someone.

ji9a9n,heyitsamess,How washing my face helped me lose weight and keep it off,"To preface this, no, unfortunately there is not a magical face wash that sheds the Ibs. 

My whole life I have gone through weight loss cycles. The ingredient that is always lacking when I start to gain weight back is discipline. Mid last year I was my heaviest and decided I needed to change, and wondered how to change my lifestyle and stick with it. Instead of starting with my eating habits, I decided to add discipline into other “easier” aspects of my life that would also benefit me before I tackled the “hard stuff” aka food consumption. 

I vowed that every single night, no matter what, I HAD to do a face wash routine. On vacation? Face wash. Sick day? Face wash. Home from the bar at 4am? Face wash. I did not make any exceptions for myself. Crying? Face wash. Since then I had lost 20lbs in 3 months (5’1F) and maintained my weight longer than I ever have before. 

In the last two months I’ve gained back 5lbs and my face looks a mess, and you know why? Because I made way too many recent exceptions to my nightly face routine.

h8kgqh,[deleted],My Journey from 250 to 190,"**Background**

For as long as I can remember I envied the people I played sports with and worked out with. We all put in the same amount of effort, yet I continued to remain overweight. It was like a sick inside joke that I wasn’t a part of. I read bodybuilding magazines, took supplements, but to no avail. I had been battling weight issues my entire life and it was something that had been subconsciously and negatively influencing my self-esteem and dating life, among other things.

When I was young, I ate whatever I pleased. I was cared for by several family members, which in turn, lead to very irregular eating patterns. I became overweight at the age of 8 and never returned. Luckily, my family pushed athletics very hard, so I was extremely physically active. Despite being a three varsity letterman in Rugby, Track and Field, and Football, it just wasn’t enough to tame my eating habits. I graduated in HS at a strong 240 lbs. Fast forward to College, where instead of experiencing the freshman 15 (or 50), I actually had the freshman -50. I lost a bunch of weight due to limited funds and having a meal plan. Great! Unfortunately, once that stopped, the weight came back.

Fast forward to the time after college up until two years ago. During this 10 year period, I ate horribly, despite running upwards of 10 miles per week. I simply didn’t understand the logic behind energy balance and healthy eating. Mind you, during this time I wasn’t actively seeking to lose weight, as I had been sorting out other more pressing issues, but it was something that deeply affected me. Clearly, I desired to be fit, or else I wouldn’t have been running religiously. At my worst, I was at 265 lbs.

Once I got on my own, I was able to make my own food choices. I was lifting heavily and playing basketball 3 to 4 times per week. I was 250 lbs at this time (shot on the left). I would workout, probably burn off 800 calories, and then go eat 1500 calories of Chinese food as my dinner on top of a hearty breakfast and lunch. I was completely oblivious to how much food I had been eating. It’s quite tragic reminiscing on these times when I look at the calories in fast food today.

**Keto**

I decided to try out Keto in late 2018. I bought a ketone monitor, tailored my diet towards a low amount of carbs, and learnt as much as I could on YouTube about it. I lost about 30 lbs in no time! This was a crucial turning point in my life. I finally realized how devilish added sugar is. Unfortunately, I didn’t last long with keto. It was about 6 months of on and off, where my mental energy really took a toll from not sticking with the diet long enough as required to make the physiologic shift to primarily burning fat.

**IF**

I decided to give IF (Intermittent Fasting) a try. It’s was so effective for me because I realized I could wait until lunch to eat everyday. I just slam water to stay full. Suddenly, I’m able to eat quite a bit of food for lunch and dinner leaving me satiated. This, in addition to giving up sugar, for another few months got me down to around 200 to 210 lbs. I’d say I was eating around 2400 calories, and although I had a regimented eating pattern, I wasn’t fully disciplined. I was still going to the bar and drinking whatever, not paying attention to what I ate at restaurants, etc.

**Satiety**

Right before covid hit, I would hover from 200 to 210. The gyms closed, which presented the perfect time to do absurd amounts of running, which I did. Despite the increased calorie burn, I still couldn’t break 200. It was a plateau. I went back to the drawing board, re-calculated my caloric intake and energy expenditure, only to realize I needed to drop my calories to 2100. This was going to be tough, as I felt 2400 calories wasn’t enough. I started adding more vegetables. People, listen… They tell you to eat vegetables for a reason! This gave me increased satiety (and kept me quite regular I might add … TMI :)). Additionally, I ramped up my protein heavily, where I’d have roughly 60g per meal. This worked! One of the major roadblocks people have when going to healthier eating habits is they just don’t feel satisfied. This, honestly, is one of the top three things you must learn to ensure continued success with your diet. When you realize this, your diet will become your lifestyle. Lastly, I decided to throw in a non-stim fat burner supplement, EVL LeanMode, which also helped greatly.

**Conclusion**

Weight loss is definitely hard, but it’s not that hard if you do it right. Given my athletic background I realize that burning the calories isn’t so much of a challenge for me as is for others. It however really comes down to what you’re eating. Clearly, my training did absolutely nothing for my entire life, because I ate poorly. When you fully comprehend that the body is a machine, whose energy balance can be calculated, where you can derive precisely the number of calories you need to lose fat, then you will have mastered living at a healthy weight. It’s really one of those lightbulb epiphany experiences. The single most helpful piece of advice I can give to you is to go to a nutritionist, a personal trainer, or copy the meal plans of others who’ve succeeded. After that, I’d say have a regimented eating plan and know how many calories you’re eating per day for 90% of your week. Give yourself a cheat meal or two, but stay within your daily caloric range. Lastly, I really want to drive home the concept of satiation. You can see that high protein, sugar control (preventing rebound hunger from blood sugar drops), and vegetables were the key to leaving me plenty satisfied.

**TLDR**

\- Started at 250 and am now at 189 over the course of 2 years. I'm 5'10.

\- My TDEE is estimated to be (BMR + remote PC work) => (1986 + 100) => 2086

\- I do IF at 2100 calories per day with \~215g protein with meal-prepping. On my weekends, I'll usually fast all day, exercise, and have a cheat meal at night (restaurants, alcohol, desert, etc).

\- I run an estimated 20 miles per week (or swap it with cycling) and resistance train 4 to 5 days a week. I train enough to create a 500 calorie daily deficit below my TDEE

\- My lifting routine consists of a push/pull split twice a week, shoulders and legs at least once per week, and abs at least 3 times per week. I may swap a session for a calesthetic based workout of mostly, chin-ups, push-ups, and core. I sometimes do Edge Strong and BodyPump workouts for fun.

\- My daily stack is 50g BulkSupplements EAAs, ON Optimen, Vitamin Shoppe Longjax MHT, EVL LeanMode, and EVL PumpMode

————————————————————————

**KEY NOTES** if you don't wanna read it all.

It’s all about having a **healthy calorie deficit** if you want to lose weight.

Work out your TDEE for your calories and be realistic about your activity.

The times of day/night you eat doesn’t matter.

You don't have to exercise to lose weight but it helps a hell of a lot

**SCALES ARE NOT THE END ALL AND BE ALL OF WEIGHT LOSS!**

Taking body measurements and a photo journal is a must.

Just move! Whatever exercise that you will do regularly is good exercise.

This process **takes a long time** so keep faith in what you’re doing! You don’t get big overnight nor do you get back down either.

————————————————————————

I have made this post due it being the most common questions asked on this sub reddit time and time again. So, I help it gives you the starting blocks to begin your FAT LOSS journey.

For a little background, I’m a qualified PT and class instructor with a basic nutritional qualification as well. **I am by no means a dietitian and never claim to be.** That’s a full-blown university thing and if you have questions about the actual food you eat, ask a dietitian not a nutritionist.

I apologize for the essay and this is as simplistic explanation as I can make but it’s basically on the money.

Enjoy.

**CALORIES**

At the end of the day its calories in vs calories out. You eat more than you burn you put on weight. You eat less than what you burn you lose weight. That is literally the end all and be all of it. You can literally sit on your butt all day and if you have eaten the correct number of calories, you will lose weight.

BUT, starving yourself is not the answer. Eating 1000 calories a day won’t make you lose weight super fast but probably just make you ill and cranky as hell. Not to mention is the biggest reason your weight loss stops completely.

A slow weight loss is usually a sign of good weight loss where good habits are being ingrained into your life and you have a healthy calorie deficit.

**Calculating Calories**

[https://tdeecalculator.net](https://tdeecalculator.net)

Your Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE) is an estimation of how many calories you burn per day with exercise is taken into account. It is calculated by first figuring out your Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR which is basically ther calories your body requires to function healthily), then multiplying that value by an activity multiplier.

Since your BMR represents how many calories your body burns when at rest, it is necessary to adjust the numbers upwards to account for the calories you burn during the day. This is true even for those with a sedentary lifestyle.

Don’t freak out that they are higher than what you expect, remember slow steady weight loss is best. 

I would also try to use some common sense here as well. Yes, you may well train 6 times a week but if you have a desk job sitting all day, it may be better to choose moderately active calories instead of heavy active.

Don’t forget this is as free general TDEE calculator. Yes, I think it’s pretty good, but I don’t take it for gospel either. If you have your body fat percentage it will help it be more accurate. The more information you can input in the more accurate your calories will be.

So many people go oh I’ll live off 1000 calories and crash and burn. Too low calories usually make you craving high fat/sugary food and binging off them and ending up eating more than you need and putting more weight on. The most common signs of your calories being too low is: Constant hunger, low energy, bad sleep, constipation, irritability and not losing weight.

**MyFitnessPal app – to track what you eat.**

Log everything you eat and drink I guarantee you its more than what you think you’re consuming.  It’s a pain in the ass I know but you like a milky tea or coffee? Milk has calories and it adds up.

Weigh your portions where possible as again you will over estimate your ability to judge the amount of food you’re putting on your plate.

**Exercise Calories**

If you have an app that links say a fitbit tracker it will add those calories to you diet allowance. If you have worked out your TDEE you should not be eating them as your exercise calories have been worked out.

If you used an app like myfitnesspal to work out your calories they typically don't use a TDEE calculation so the additional calories can be added BUT I find trackers are very fickle and inaccurate. They usually overestimate what you are actually burning.

With these I would always err on the side of caution. The majority of past clients found that only eating a quarter to a half of the suggested calories caused better results as their weight was severely hindered when eating the full suggested extra calories.

**DIETS DIETS DIETS!**

Boy don’t we love our latest diet trends don’t we? Want to know the best diet?

**The one that you can sustain is the best diet!**

Keto, intermittent fasting, weight watchers, slimmer’s world, MacDonald’s diet. It really doesn’t matter, as they are all designed one way or another to cause a calorie deficit.

A healthy balanced diet is preferable but not wholly necessary when it comes to losing weight but again recommended.

**I don’t know what to eat for my calorie bracket**

[https://www.eatthismuch.com](https://www.eatthismuch.com) – for recipe help.

This will help for food ideas if you want variety in your life (I’m a chicken for life every day 7 days a week guy but I use a plethora of spices to keep things interesting so don't judge the bro science lol).

Play around and you will eventually figure out what works for you.

Personally I think the best thing for your food is once you have your calories worked out is to use a macro break. That’s the breakdown of how much protein, fats and carbs you eat (MyFitnessPal can track that for you).

I would go for a 40% Protein, 40% Fats and 20% Carbs as a break. Protein and fats help you feel fuller for longer and generally more satisfied when eaten. Protein also helps keep your muscle mass while losing weight. Especially if exercising regularly.

I for the most part make sure I eat my quota of protein and don’t worry too much about the break of fats and carbs as long as I hit my calorie goal.

Admittedly though I always feel the most satisfied when I keep to the macro break stated as I also fast for 19 hours a day and re-feed over 5 hours in the evening.

Do I recommend fasting for 19 hours? Nah not really but with my lifestyle and work it suits me and that’s all that matters. **Remember the best diet is the one you can sustain after all.** My girlfriend needs 3 meals a day with one snack or she will try rip my bloody arm off so, lets just say the basic intermittent fasting diet did not work for her :P

**EXERCISE!**

Hard line is just move. Move more burn more. Do something, anything that you will do regularly.

There is no excuse to not do something. Period. You can work around injury, time, physical ability, available equipment etc.

Hate gyms? Don’t go to one. Can’t run? Then walk. Walking hurts? Cycle, swim, row, cross trainer. There are multiple things you can do and saying that you can’t isn’t one of them. Just move, be active and try to do something you enjoy as then you will keep doing it.

I think doing a good weight regime with some HIIT training for 15-20 mins after is the most effective thing to do.

But if you cant exercise for whatever reason, check out this post from my old mentor who couldn't exercise anymore due to his condition.

[https://www.instagram.com/p/BnlVF4BnHmm/?igshid=10c0kx56iwloh](https://www.instagram.com/p/BnlVF4BnHmm/?igshid=10c0kx56iwloh)

Also weight lifting will not make you bulky. Especially on a calorie deficit. Worst case scenario your scales don’t move but you get slimmer as muscle is denser than fat. Which leads me to….

**SCALES AND WEIGHT LOSS MEASUREMENT**

Scales, scales, scales, the equipment that measures your relation to the earth that forever make us cry ourselves to sleep. Guys use them with a pinch of salt please.

Don’t aim to lose a certain amount each week. Just aim to lose. And accept it’s not a temporary measure it’s a lifestyle change and going to take a long time. Accept that. Plan for the long term and screw beach body ready crap.

Take measurements once a month, weigh yourself and take a photo once a week (I recommend the app FitStitch as you can put a password on it if you desire to save any embarrassment). If the trend is basically downwards, you’re doing great and it’s going the right way.

[https://inthehereandnow.com/blog/exercise/51-fitness-testing/215-how-to-take-girth-measurements](https://inthehereandnow.com/blog/exercise/51-fitness-testing/215-how-to-take-girth-measurements)

Gives a good basic idea where to take measurement but ideally get a trusted friend to do it for you as they are less likely to squeeze an extra inch out of it and it will be more accurate with you in a neutral relaxed position.

Weigh, photo and measure at same time of day each time. I bet if you weighed yourself multiple times in one day, every one of those times you stood on the scales would be different. If you miss your normal weekly slot just do it the next day and save potential “oh mah gawd I gained like 5 more pounds, but I been soooooo good help me!!!”

Ladies your natural cycle can affect your weight greatly (you probably already know this) so try not to forget it if the scales mess you around a bit.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/cm8hlt/one\_for\_the\_ladies\_who\_i\_see\_posting\_about\_lack/](https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/cm8hlt/one_for_the_ladies_who_i_see_posting_about_lack/)

Explains this better than a male like me so I will leave the ladies to read up on another trainer I respect.

**SPEED OF WEIGHTLOSS**

Don’t freak if you’re not loosing weight quickly especially if you workout a lot more than you did before and look at past photos and check your measurements at the end of the month. I have had clients get heavier than what they started but look leaner and a hell of a lot more toned up.

When you change your diet and if you don’t get a change in 4 weeks, drop it by 100-200 calories and try again or recalculate them.

Just because it doesn’t drop right away don’t go dropping it down another 500 calories.

At the same time don’t take your calories for gospel and recalculate them again if you’ve lost 3-6kg/7-14lbs. That’s a lot of weight to lose and your calories will have changed. So, recalculate reasonably regularly but don’t obsess either.

They say losing 0.5% - 1% of your bodyweight is a generally healthy amount. Again don’t obsess if its more or less and if you are worried if its over 1% of your bodyweight regularly go see a doctor to talk about it.

**BUT I CAN’T DO ANY OF THIS (you can btw) AND I FAIL ALL THE TIME**

If you done all the TDEE stuff and feel like you can’t adhere to it just get in the baby steps.

Drink loads of fizzy drinks? Switch to water or Zero calorie versions.

Change one meal consistently for 4 weeks. Say start with any snacks you eat for 4 weeks. Got that down to pat? Now do snacks and breakfast for another 4 weeks. Then snacks, breakfast and lunch for 4 weeks etc.

The slow eventual change will work out in the end and in say 4-5 months that better eating lifestyle will just feel normal.

If there is any one meal you struggle on just try doing another one first instead or take more time focusing on that one meal. If it takes you 8 weeks to just change breakfast the chances are lunch will be a hell of a lot easier to get the hang of etc.

Good luck!

Play around and you will eventually figure out what works for you.

Personally I think the best thing for your food is once you have your calories worked out is to use a macro break. That’s the breakdown of how much protein, fats and carbs you eat (MyFitnessPal can track that for you).

I would go for a 40% Protein, 40% Fats and 20% Carbs as a break. Protein and fats help you feel fuller for longer and generally more satisfied when eaten. Protein also helps keep your muscle mass while losing weight. Especially if exercising regularly.

I for the most part make sure I eat my quota of protein and don’t worry too much about the break of fats and carbs as long as I hit my calorie goal.

Admittedly though I always feel the most satisfied when I keep to the macro break stated as I also fast for 19 hours a day and re-feed over 5 hours in the evening.

Do I recommend fasting for 19 hours? Nah not really but with my lifestyle and work it suits me and that’s all that matters. **Remember the best diet is the one you can sustain after all.** My girlfriend needs 3 meals a day with one snack or she will try rip my bloody arm off so, lets just say the basic intermittent fasting diet did not work for her :P

**EXERCISE!**

Hard line is just move. Move more burn more. Do something, anything that you will do regularly.

There is no excuse to not do something. Period. You can work around injury, time, physical ability, available equipment etc.

Hate gyms? Don’t go to one. Can’t run? Then walk. Walking hurts? Cycle, swim, row, cross trainer. There are multiple things you can do and saying that you can’t isn’t one of them. Just move, be active and try to do something you enjoy as then you will keep doing it.

I think doing a good weight regime with some HIIT training for 15-20 mins after is the most effective thing to do.

But if you cant exercise for whatever reason, check out this post from my old mentor who couldn't exercise anymore due to his condition.

Also weight lifting will not make you bulky. Especially on a calorie deficit. Worst case scenario your scales don’t move but you get slimmer as muscle is denser than fat. Which leads me to….

**SCALES AND WEIGHT LOSS MEASUREMENT**

Scales, scales, scales, the equipment that measures your relation to the earth that forever make us cry ourselves to sleep. Guys use them with a pinch of salt please.

Don’t aim to lose a certain amount each week. Just aim to lose. And accept it’s not a temporary measure it’s a lifestyle change and going to take a long time. Accept that. Plan for the long term and screw beach body ready crap.

Take measurements once a month, weigh yourself and take a photo once a week (I recommend the app FitStitch as you can put a password on it if you desire to save any embarrassment). If the trend is basically downwards, you’re doing great and it’s going the right way.

[https://inthehereandnow.com/blog/exercise/51-fitness-testing/215-how-to-take-girth-measurements](https://inthehereandnow.com/blog/exercise/51-fitness-testing/215-how-to-take-girth-measurements)

Gives a good basic idea where to take measurement but ideally get a trusted friend to do it for you as they are less likely to squeeze an extra inch out of it and it will be more accurate with you in a neutral relaxed position.

Weigh, photo and measure at same time of day each time. I bet if you weighed yourself multiple times in one day, every one of those times you stood on the scales would be different. If you miss your normal weekly slot just do it the next day and save potential “oh mah gawd I gained like 5 more pounds, but I been soooooo good help me!!!”

Ladies your natural cycle can affect your weight greatly (you probably already know this) so try not to forget it if the scales mess you around a bit.

Explains this better than a male like me so I will leave the ladies to read up on another trainer I respect.

**SPEED OF WEIGHTLOSS**

Don’t freak if you’re not loosing weight quickly especially if you workout a lot more than you did before and look at past photos and check your measurements at the end of the month. I have had clients get heavier than what they started but look leaner and a hell of a lot more toned up.

When you change your diet and if you don’t get a change in 4 weeks, drop it by 100-200 calories and try again or recalculate them.

Just because it doesn’t drop right away don’t go dropping it down another 500 calories.

At the same time don’t take your calories for gospel and recalculate them again if you’ve lost 3-6kg/7-14lbs. That’s a lot of weight to lose and your calories will have changed. So, recalculate reasonably regularly but don’t obsess either.

They say losing 0.5% - 1% of your bodyweight is a generally healthy amount. Again don’t obsess if its more or less and if you are worried if its over 1% of your bodyweight regularly go see a doctor to talk about it.

**BUT I CAN’T DO ANY OF THIS (you can btw) AND I FAIL ALL THE TIME**

If you done all the TDEE stuff and feel like you can’t adhere to it just get in the baby steps.

Drink loads of fizzy drinks? Switch to water or Zero calorie versions.

Change one meal consistently for 4 weeks. Say start with any snacks you eat for 4 weeks. Got that down to pat? Now do snacks and breakfast for another 4 weeks. Then snacks, breakfast and lunch for 4 weeks etc.

The slow eventual change will work out in the end and in say 4-5 months that better eating lifestyle will just feel normal.

If there is any one meal you struggle on just try doing another one first instead or take more time focusing on that one meal. If it takes you 8 weeks to just change breakfast the chances are lunch will be a hell of a lot easier to get the hang of etc.

Good luck!

14gyl1y,amy23_,First time at the gym-lasted less than 5 minutes but I went,"Like the title says, I’m 28 (f) and just been to the gym for the first time in my life.

I’m 126kg 5ft7inch

I went on the cross trainer/elliptical machine as in my head that seemed that the simplest thing to understand and even if there was a lot of people around I could work it out. 

I lasted less than 5 minutes and left. I pretended that I got a phone call, which might be more embarrassing than just leaving.
But I’m still so proud I actually went into the gym and got a bit of a sweat on.

My question is.. is it normal for knees to feel wobbly/bouncy(?) after getting off the machine?

Or if I started walking more would that also help?

I would say my main goal is to feel healthier but with that weight loss is bound to follow with the size I am now!

Edit-
Thankyou so much everyone! I’ve been a lurker on here for a bit and didn’t expect this many responses. Reading all the comments I think I was maybe a bit naive about the crosstrainer.

I’m 126kg 5ft7inch

I went on the cross trainer/elliptical machine as in my head that seemed that the simplest thing to understand and even if there was a lot of people around I could work it out. 

I lasted less than 5 minutes and left. I pretended that I got a phone call, which might be more embarrassing than just leaving.
But I’m still so proud I actually went into the gym and got a bit of a sweat on.

My question is.. is it normal for knees to feel wobbly/bouncy(?) after getting off the machine?

Or if I started walking more would that also help?

I would say my main goal is to feel healthier but with that weight loss is bound to follow with the size I am now!

Edit-
Thankyou so much everyone! I’ve been a lurker on here for a bit and didn’t expect this many responses. Reading all the comments I think I was maybe a bit naive about the crosstrainer. I didn’t have any pain, I just felt like my legs could’ve given way so I was worried about doing that. Once I was sat in my car I was fine, I just took a minute and drove home.

mr6rf5,Foster_NBA,My 30 pound weight loss; my advice.,"Disclaimer; I still have about 40-50 more pounds before I hit my ultimate goal.

after seeing how so many people here struggle to lose 20, even 10 pounds, I finally realized how hard it is to lose 30. I tried to lose weight DOZENS of times since the age of 16. I’m almost 22 now. 6 years of obesity is not fun. Most times I would try a diet like vegan or keto or workout like crazy, a few times a simple calorie deficit... here is some things I learned.

1. Don’t try to lose weight at an unreasonable rate, you WILL backslide, lose your progress, and you’ll probably hate it. You’re body will hate it to. 3/4 of my failures are because of this.

2. calories is the ultimate name of the game, if your body uses more than it consumes, you will lose weight. (Duh) but that doesn’t mean you will get success eating lots of fast food daily and think you can work it off. You can’t outrun a garbage diet. Not a severely bad one.

3. you *gotta* incorporate healthy food into your diet, permanently. You Don’t  need to expel unhealthy food 100%, but you really do need to eat some vegetables. this is single handedly the biggest advice I can give you. Your stomach doesn’t want just “calories” it wants volume... the vegetables will give you satisfaction in terms of feeling full.

4. Be sure to still eat a reasonable amount of calories, if you literally starve yourself your body will go into a starvation mode, where it will not only slow weight loss, but also consume your muscle. You’ll become weaker, and be at a much greater risk of all kinds of health problems. 

5. Building on 4, calorie deficit was how I lost the weight. Calculate how much calories your body needs to maintain your current weight with a calorie calculator. Get that maintain number, subtract 500-1000 calories; don’t subtract any more than 1000 calories per day. I suggest 500. You will lose approximately 1-2 pounds, however, it’s not a perfect science.

Here is the one I use.
https://www.calculator.net/calorie-calculator.html

6. If you suddenly get hungry, try drinking water, your body sometimes thinks it’s hungry when really it’s thirsty. After all, you get a lot of your water *from* food. 

7. Working it out is nice, but diet really is god in the weight loss game, consider working out to be a supplement.

8. Sugar is probably your worst enemy in terms of details with your nutrition. It’s not a huge deal, but all your foods with low nutrition value and high calories contain heavy sugar. Ice cream, all that aunt Debby bull crap. That’s your worst enemy, at least with other bad stuff like fried chicken, For example, you will eventually get full, and get some protein. None of that with sugar. Not that fried chicken is great lol.

9. Also, get rid of the sugary soda, and all the other sugar beverages, you should be eating most of your calories, not drinking them. That stuff is literally poison.

10. Avoid drinking, even that low calorie stuff will ruin your reasoning and will power, a beer here and there isn’t gonna ruin you. But when you have 4-10 drinks you are literally ruining days of progress. I also eat way more when I’m drinking, because my reasoning is altered. Weight loss should be about being healthy, you can have a few but take it easy. 

11. Lastly, when you’re losing weight, if you’re *miserable* during it, you’re probably not doing it right. Long term success requires you to change your long term *habits*. That means you gotta ease yourself into health. 

12. Get creative with weight loss, try out a new food, consider a sport or find a friend to have as a workout buddy. What helped me out big time was to become excited to eat healthy and to workout.

I hope one of these 12 tips helps you somehow, I’ll answer any questions you guys have, but I’ve gotta say 30 pounds of lost weight has really been good for my health and confidence, it’s worth it to invest into this journey.

k84dok,[deleted],How I lost 45 pounds in 6 months without any exercise,"I (23,F) am 5'4 and I weigh 115 pounds. About a year ago I was 160 pounds. I went from a size large to a size small, and my US pant size went from a 29 to a 25. I lost weight without any extensive efforts and wanted to share some tips that helped me shed weight quickly and didn't take much work at all. In fact I was surprised how easy it was. 

I should start by saying that truthfully, I didn't work out at all during my weight loss. I know that's not healthy and that everyone should exercise but the truth is I'm pretty lazy, part of why I was a little overweight to begin with. **I'm not going to pretend like my advice is the healthiest advice you'll ever get but these things were extremely effective for me to lose weight quickly and easily.** 

I made these small simple changes that went a long way, and each one of them can make a big difference. These changes were made in combination with calories counting, I went from 2,000 calories a day to around 1,200 calories a day. Anything less than this made me feel weak and moody. 

&#x200B;

1. **Stop thinking that breaking your diet in the morning is an excuse to break it for the rest of the day.** Continuing to eat badly all day because you did at one point makes as much sense as cracking your phone screen and then intentionally cracking it again because its already cracked. 
2. **If you don't exercise, fine, me neither, but move your body somehow.** I spent years laying in bed too much. I made a rule that Ill only lay in bed when I'm going to sleep. I also started walking a little. 20 minutes of walking a day made a difference for my weight and mood. Maybe take the stairs instead of the elevator or start walking to the coffee shop that's 3 blocks away instead of the one across the street. 
3. **Stop drinking soda.** Don't even go for diet soda. Stop drinking juice. Only drink water, coffee or natural tea. Sugary iced tea doesn't count as natural tea. if you put milk in your coffee/tea, switch to skim milk, it tastes fine. If you use sugar, switch to a zero calorie one, my favorite tasting one is sweet n' low. **Drink as much water as humanly freaking possible.** Flush that system clean. They say a lot of your weight comes out in your breath and your urine. So **start peeing!** 
4. **Get your poops in order.** When I was overweight I was struggling with constipation on a basis. Getting regular really helped. Regularity is different for everyone. For me its usually once a day in the morning. Fiber gummies really helped me get on a schedule with that. I don't suggest taking these for constipation though, and if you are constipated, avoid stimulant laxatives if you can. I abused them for weight loss purposes and never saw any real weight loss this way, steer away from that tempting BS. 
5. **Stop eating pasta and bread**. You don't need to cut out carbs altogether but don't let carbs be the main part of any meal. I got most of my carbs from rice while losing weight. 
6. **There's alternatives to candy**, the brand Smart Sweets is basically fake candy but if you eat it enough you'll convince yourself its as good as regular sweets. They do taste pretty good and they're good for you, they have probiotic fiber and they do have a little sugar but very minimal. Find them in Target, GNC, Whole Foods, or just order them online. They're a little pricey but well worth it. 
7. **Only eat when you're hungry**, and this may be my most unhealthy tip as they say you should eat several small meals a day, however I honestly only date dinner. I don't wake up with an appetite and if I do, it goes away after I have my morning coffee. Then I go to work and try not to have lunch. After work I'm hungry and I eat dinner, then I try to forget about food and if I really need to snack I'll go for some fruits, veggies or the smart sweets I spoke about above. 
8. **Think ahead.** Going out to dinner for a friends birthday tomorrow night? Keep that in mind starting from when you wake up. Don't have a huge lunch just to have a huge dinner hours later. 
9. **Thinspiration is a waste of time and won't help you lose weight.** You're never going to look like the models on Instagram. Why? Because they don't look like that either. They edit their pictures. If you chase goals that aren't possible you'll never accomplish anything. 

I might get bashed for these tips because I know this is not doctor grade advice but I just wanted to share in hopes that someone else's weight loss journey could be as easy as mine.",819,60,2020-12-07T04:42:26,WeightLossAdvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/k84dok/how_i_lost_45_pounds_in_6_months_without_any/,0.96,True,/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/k84dok/how_i_lost_45_pounds_in_6_months_without_any/,2025-10-27T19:37:56.366551,"How I lost 45 pounds in 6 months without any exercise I (23,F) am 5'4 and I weigh 115 pounds. About a year ago I was 160 pounds. I went from a size large to a size small, and my US pant size went from a 29 to a 25. I lost weight without any extensive efforts and wanted to share some tips that helped me shed weight quickly and didn't take much work at all. In fact I was surprised how easy it was. 

I should start by saying that truthfully, I didn't work out at all during my weight loss. I know that's not healthy and that everyone should exercise but the truth is I'm pretty lazy, part of why I was a little overweight to begin with. **I'm not going to pretend like my advice is the healthiest advice you'll ever get but these things were extremely effective for me to lose weight quickly and easily.** 

I made these small simple changes that went a long way, and each one of them can make a big difference. These changes were made in combination with calories counting, I went from 2,000 calories a day to around 1,200 calories a day. Anything less than this made me feel weak and moody. 

&#x200B;

1. **Stop thinking that breaking your diet in the morning is an excuse to break it for the rest of the day.** Continuing to eat badly all day because you did at one point makes as much sense as cracking your phone screen and then intentionally cracking it again because its already cracked. 
2. **If you don't exercise, fine, me neither, but move your body somehow.** I spent years laying in bed too much. I made a rule that Ill only lay in bed when I'm going to sleep. I also started walking a little. 20 minutes of walking a day made a difference for my weight and mood. Maybe take the stairs instead of the elevator or start walking to the coffee shop that's 3 blocks away instead of the one across the street. 
3. **Stop drinking soda.** Don't even go for diet soda. Stop drinking juice. Only drink water, coffee or natural tea. Sugary iced tea doesn't count as natural tea. if you put milk in your coffee/tea, switch to skim milk, it tastes fine. If you use sugar, switch to a zero calorie one, my favorite tasting one is sweet n' low. **Drink as much water as humanly freaking possible.** Flush that system clean.

1lt2214,adelinegaglio,How I Ruined My Health for Life by Losing Weight (A Warning),"In 2024, I (F25) was 5'5"" and weighed 198 lbs. I had reached the obesity range according to my BMI after months of taking antidepressants and anti-anxiety medication, and consuming a high-calorie diet.  
I didn’t recognize myself anymore. I had never been obese in my life—I used to work out a lot when I was younger, I had a lean and muscular body, and everything changed incredibly fast.

I was in a toxic relationship for three years, and I was emotionally abused about my weight. My partner at the time forced me to weigh myself naked every morning and wrote down my weight to the exact gram. I eventually decided to leave and take control of my life, on my own.

But I did it in an extreme way that would have serious consequences for the rest of my life.  
I severely restricted my calories, ate only once a day, constantly did intermittent fasting, and lost nearly 88 lbs in just a few months. I had a slim body again, I was getting compliments, and people found me attractive again—I could feel it. Even though I had no muscle tone and had lost my curves, I didn’t care because others liked how I looked, and more importantly, I liked myself again.

At the beginning of 2025, I started experiencing unbearable pain in my stomach, on the right side just below my ribs. I thought it might be related to my period—it would last for a few minutes to an hour and then go away, so I didn’t worry too much.  
But in March, I had a major episode—same pain, but much worse, along with vomiting, fever, and diarrhea—for nearly 8 hours.

I went to the ER, underwent tests, and the diagnosis came in: my gallbladder was full of stones and I needed emergency surgery.  
The formation of the stones, in my case, was due to prolonged undernutrition. Gallbladder issues can also be hereditary, etc.

I had surgery on May 21, 2025, and since then, my days have been filled with abdominal and chest pain. I can’t eat a lot of foods anymore—everything has to be carefully planned and measured.

Please, I beg you—be cautious with your weight loss. Get help from professionals. Don’t do it alone. Take your time, and above all, take care of yourself.",790,102,2025-07-06T19:35:26,WeightLossAdvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/1lt2214/how_i_ruined_my_health_for_life_by_losing_weight/,0.93,True,/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/1lt2214/how_i_ruined_my_health_for_life_by_losing_weight/,2025-10-27T19:38:09.044298,"How I Ruined My Health for Life by Losing Weight (A Warning) In 2024, I (F25) was 5'5"" and weighed 198 lbs.

At the beginning of 2025, I started experiencing unbearable pain in my stomach, on the right side just below my ribs. I thought it might be related to my period—it would last for a few minutes to an hour and then go away, so I didn’t worry too much.  
But in March, I had a major episode—same pain, but much worse, along with vomiting, fever, and diarrhea—for nearly 8 hours.

I went to the ER, underwent tests, and the diagnosis came in: my gallbladder was full of stones and I needed emergency surgery.  
The formation of the stones, in my case, was due to prolonged undernutrition. Gallbladder issues can also be hereditary, etc.

I had surgery on May 21, 2025, and since then, my days have been filled with abdominal and chest pain. I can’t eat a lot of foods anymore—everything has to be carefully planned and measured.

Please, I beg you—be cautious with your weight loss. Get help from professionals. Don’t do it alone. Take your time, and above all, take care of yourself.",ruin health life lose weight warning weigh lbs reach obesity range accord bmi take antidepressant anti anxiety medication consume high calorie diet recognize anymore never obese life use work lot young lean muscular body everything change incredibly fast toxic relationship three year emotionally abuse weight partner time force weigh naked every morning write weight exact gram eventually decide leave take control life extreme way would serious consequence rest life severely restrict calorie eat constantly intermittent fasting lose nearly lbs slim body get compliment people find attractive could feel even though muscle tone lose curve care like look importantly like beginning start experience unbearable pain stomach right side rib think might relate period would last minute hour away worry much march major episode pain much bad along vomiting fever diarrhea nearly hour underwent test diagnosis come gallbladder full stone need emergency surgery formation stone case due prolonged undernutrition gallbladder issue also hereditary etc surgery may since fill abdominal chest pain eat lot food anymore everything carefully plan measure please beg cautious weight loss get help professional alone take time take care,"['ruin', 'health', 'life', 'lose', 'weight', 'warning', 'weigh', 'lbs', 'reach', 'obesity', 'range', 'accord', 'bmi', 'take', 'antidepressant', 'anti', 'anxiety', 'medication', 'consume', 'high', 'calorie', 'diet', 'recognize', 'anymore', 'never', 'obese', 'life', 'use', 'work', 'lot', 'young', 'lean', 'muscular', 'body', 'everything', 'change', 'incredibly', 'fast', 'toxic', 'relationship', 'three', 'year', 'emotionally', 'abuse', 'weight', 'partner', 'time', 'force', 'weigh', 'naked', 'every', 'morning', 'write', 'weight', 'exact', 'gram', 'eventually', 'decide', 'leave', 'take', 'control', 'life', 'extreme', 'way', 'would', 'serious', 'consequence', 'rest', 'life', 'severely', 'restrict', 'calorie', 'eat', 'constantly', 'intermittent', 'fasting', 'lose', 'nearly', 'lbs', 'slim', 'body', 'get', 'compliment', 'people', 'find', 'attractive', 'could', 'feel', 'even', 'though', 'muscle', 'tone', 'lose', 'curve', 'care', 'like', 'look', 'importantly', 'like', 'beginning', 'start', 'experience', 'unbearable', 'pain', 'stomach', 'right', 'side', 'rib', 'think', 'might', 'relate', 'period', 'would', 'last', 'minute', 'hour', 'away', 'worry', 'much', 'march', 'major', 'episode', 'pain', 'much', 'bad', 'along', 'vomiting', 'fever', 'diarrhea', 'nearly', 'hour', 'underwent', 'test', 'diagnosis', 'come', 'gallbladder', 'full', 'stone', 'need', 'emergency', 'surgery', 'formation', 'stone', 'case', 'due', 'prolonged', 'undernutrition', 'gallbladder', 'issue', 'also', 'hereditary', 'etc', 'surgery', 'may', 'since', 'fill', 'abdominal', 'chest', 'pain', 'eat', 'lot', 'food', 'anymore', 'everything', 'carefully', 'plan', 'measure', 'please', 'beg', 'cautious', 'weight', 'loss', 'get', 'help', 'professional', 'alone', 'take', 'time', 'take', 'care']",180,post,1lt2214

In May, I was 266lbs and did not weigh myself much after that. Beginning of August I stopped the daily binge-drinking and weed-smoking that brought on munchies. On Nov. 6 I bought a scale, a tape measure, downloaded MyFitnessPal, and weighed in at 250.6 lbs. I started CICO and 30-min daily at-home workouts and in one month I lost 11 lbs! I have worked out every single day since November 6th which is something I never thought I would say. I also lost 4 inches off of my waist. Most other places I measured stayed the same or lost only about half an inch to an inch, but I am so proud of the 4in off my waist.  

I’m so glad to see all of my hard work and discipline has been paying off. I love being able to say that my GW:160 is only 80lbs away! 100 seemed so daunting, but 80 isn’t that bad now that I’m figuring this weight loss stuff out.

Through setbacks, injuries, stagnation, loss of motivation, through it all I had discipline. I love myself for sticking through it all. I love the guy on the right for deciding to make a change. I’ve done a lot of work regarding my relationship with food vs. my relationship with my body. It changed everything for me. For anyone hoping to make a change in any aspect of your life, my advice is do the psychological work as early and as often as possible. To me a person’s value isn’t based on what kind of shape they’re in, but I will tell you, moving your body and eating healthy does a lot of good for your brain chemistry. If happiness is the goal, I believe treating your body with love and respect is half the battle.

ktm4mn,Ryye,The key to weight loss is self discipline,"There are various reasons, explanations, and excuses as to why people eat unhealthy or lose progress because of bad decisions.  

Weight loss is a mind game based off your actions, however with confidence and the appropriate mindset, there is so much to accomplish.  

Holidays, social events, and seeing the pounds fall off on the scale can give people many reasons to reward themselves for sticking with their diets and lifestyle changes but it’s important to never lose focus of what the end goal is.  

At the end the day, self discipline is imperative because it allows you to accomplish your goal while also including a “cheat day” from time to time.

I dare each and every one of you to work on yourself for six months.  I dare you to shut out the world.  I dare you to shut out ALL the distractions.  I dare you to give up everything that is keeping you from your dreams.

I've been lurking here for a while and I've made a couple of posts here and there, but I've been successfully consistently losing weight and feeling satisfied!

Fage 0% greek yogurt. I hate plain yogurt personally, but I didn't realize what all you could do to it. My favorite thing is to add ranch seasoning and dip veggies into it! But I also will add lemon juice, shaved Cucumber, and random seasonings for a ""tzatziki"" sauce/dip, or add sugar free cheesecake jello mix to make it taste like a dessert (sometimes I'll add a chopped up barebell protein bar too).

Good Culture Cottage Cheese. I was never much of a cottage cheese fan until I tried this kind. I love it and I'll eat it plain, but today I blended it with eggs and added ham chunks and made delicious egg bites.

I'm addicted to the fairlife protein shakes (specifically the ones that are 30g of protein for 150 calories). I personally grew up on chocolate milk and these don't taste protein-ey to me.

Potatoes. I didn't realize how many you could eat for low calories. They're easier to cook than rice. I just dice mine small and put them in ym veggie steamer until soft and then air fry them! So so sooo good.

1k9ujh7,br3cad,I didn’t lose weight because I ate less. I lost weight because I ate different.,"For YEARS I thought the answer was to just “eat less” and “move more.” And every time I failed I blamed myself. I thought I was weak. Lazy. Broken. But the real problem? I was eating the wrong foods every single day — and it was sabotaging me without me even realizing it.

Here’s how it unfolded:

At my heaviest, I was pounding pasta, bread, cereals, ""healthy"" granola bars and drinking juices thinking they were “better choices.” Even when I ate in a calorie deficit, the weight clung to me. My cravings were insane. I was tired all the time. I couldn’t stop thinking about food. I thought this was just how life was.

The turning point came when I got desperate enough to start tracking not just calories but carbs and sugar. I was shocked to realize how sugar was sneaking into nearly everything even stuff labeled “low-fat” or “healthy.” I was eating what felt like ""normal food,"" but it was blasting my insulin levels sky-high every single day, trapping my body in fat-storage mode.

So I made one change I cut way down on refined carbs and sugars and switched to more whole foods meat eggs Avocados. I stopped fearing fat (this was huge fat is not the enemy).

In just 2 weeks, I wasn’t constantly starving anymore. My energy levels went through the roof. And the weight? It started falling off without me even trying that hard. I wasn’t battling cravings every second of the day.

Fast forward 6 months: 18 pounds down

The craziest part? I eat more volume now than I did when I was ""dieting"" — but because it's the right food, my body actually knows what to do with it.

Moral of the story:

It’s not just about “eating less.” It’s about eating the right foods that work with your body instead of against it.",735,50,2025-04-28T18:09:41,WeightLossAdvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/1k9ujh7/i_didnt_lose_weight_because_i_ate_less_i_lost/,0.9,True,/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/1k9ujh7/i_didnt_lose_weight_because_i_ate_less_i_lost/,2025-10-27T19:38:43.684280,"I didn’t lose weight because I ate less.

nfi1lb,drvalo55,Today I donated all my fat clothes,"As my title says, today I donated my fat clothes. Over the last almost 4 1/2 years I have lost 155 pounds. I have gone from a 4x pant (maybe larger) to a size 18. And a 3x shirt (maybe larger) to a 12-14. I know, I still have a bigger butt, but I now wear a regular size. I still have more to go. My goal at this point is to just get under 200. I have yo-yoed my whole life. Some of the clothes I donated today were ones that had fit me when I lost the last time. They were all too big. So, basically, I had dieted myself to a huge weight after all my previous attempts. 

So what is different about this time?

1. I did/do not diet. Yes, I ate/eat fewer calories than I burned, but I did/do not do IF, or low carb, or keto, or restrictions of any kind. I just eat at a slight calorie deficit. I eat anything I have a taste for, always. I simply add it to my food log. There is no good or bad food. Anything in moderation is on the menu. 

2. You are your habits. I changed my habits. I eat basically a Mediterranean diet. I meal plan. I don’t usually meal prep, but I always know what I am going to eat. Fruit is usually my snack and it is washed and ready to eat. But chocolate goes here too. 

3. I drink only water, unsweetened tea (iced and hot with lemon juice), my breakfast coffee with a little cream. 

4. I schedule exercise. I go to classes. I found my peeps. That 6 month gym closure put a bump in that, but as soon as I could, I was right back there. There is a certain degree of accountability to going to classes. People miss me when I am not there. But I also found classes I absolutely love. My old health club membership included one session with a personal trainer. He created a plan for me for all sort of floor machines and such.  What I learned from that, other than how to use the machines, was I hated that. So, classes are my thing, including water aerobics.

5. Finally, I weigh every day. I do not obsess about my weight. I do it because I never want my weight to get away from me again. And it helps me understand normal fluctuations. 

I will say that I practiced none of these habits before. I did not change them all at once. It was a gradual change. But now it is how I roll. This is why I believe this time is different. And why I believed I could donate ALL my clothes.  

I have had long periods where I did not lose. I just read today that that is probably a good thing. Those plateaus can actually change your weight set point. So don’t be discouraged when that happens. In fact, yesterday I just broke a plateau of about 6 weeks where I was losing and gaining the same 5 damn pounds. Because I work out, my loss has also been slower because I am gaining muscle, but I am definitely smaller. Weight loss and fat loss are not the same thing. 

So what have I learned? 

It’s not about your weight. It is about your health. I am still fat; obese by BMI measures. But I am metabolically healthy; no health concerns at all according to my doctor (did he look at me?). All my numbers are pretty perfect, including blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood sugar. Focus on your health. Each a balanced diet of all foods. Fill your body with the healthiest food you can. Move your body for your overall health (those numbers) although exercise is not that helpful for weight loss. And be kind to and forgiving of yourself.",727,42,2021-05-18T23:51:18,WeightLossAdvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/nfi1lb/today_i_donated_all_my_fat_clothes/,0.99,True,/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/nfi1lb/today_i_donated_all_my_fat_clothes/,2025-10-27T19:38:47.497902,"Today I donated all my fat clothes As my title says, today I donated my fat clothes.

I eat anything I have a taste for, always. I simply add it to my food log. There is no good or bad food. Anything in moderation is on the menu. 

2. You are your habits. I changed my habits. I eat basically a Mediterranean diet. I meal plan. I don’t usually meal prep, but I always know what I am going to eat. Fruit is usually my snack and it is washed and ready to eat. But chocolate goes here too. 

3. I drink only water, unsweetened tea (iced and hot with lemon juice), my breakfast coffee with a little cream. 

4. I schedule exercise. I go to classes. I found my peeps. That 6 month gym closure put a bump in that, but as soon as I could, I was right back there. There is a certain degree of accountability to going to classes. People miss me when I am not there. But I also found classes I absolutely love. My old health club membership included one session with a personal trainer. He created a plan for me for all sort of floor machines and such.  What I learned from that, other than how to use the machines, was I hated that. So, classes are my thing, including water aerobics.

5. Finally, I weigh every day. I do not obsess about my weight. I do it because I never want my weight to get away from me again. And it helps me understand normal fluctuations. 

I will say that I practiced none of these habits before. I did not change them all at once. It was a gradual change. But now it is how I roll. This is why I believe this time is different. And why I believed I could donate ALL my clothes.  

I have had long periods where I did not lose. I just read today that that is probably a good thing. Those plateaus can actually change your weight set point. So don’t be discouraged when that happens. In fact, yesterday I just broke a plateau of about 6 weeks where I was losing and gaining the same 5 damn pounds. Because I work out, my loss has also been slower because I am gaining muscle, but I am definitely smaller. Weight loss and fat loss are not the same thing. 

So what have I learned? 

It’s not about your weight. It is about your health. I am still fat; obese by BMI measures. But I am metabolically healthy; no health concerns at all according to my doctor (did he look at me?). All my numbers are pretty perfect, including blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood sugar. Focus on your health. Each a balanced diet of all foods. Fill your body with the healthiest food you can. Move your body for your overall health (those numbers) although exercise is not that helpful for weight loss. And be kind to and forgiving of yourself.",today donate fat clothe title say today donate fat clothe last almost year lose pound pant maybe large size shirt maybe large know still big butt wear regular size still goal point get yoe whole life clothe donate today one fit lose last time big basically diet huge weight previous attempt different time diet yes eat eat calorie burn low carb keto restriction kind eat slight calorie deficit eat anything taste always simply add food log good bad food anything moderation menu habit change habit eat basically mediterranean diet meal plan usually meal prep always know eat fruit usually snack wash ready eat chocolate drink water unsweetene tea iced hot lemon juice breakfast coffee little cream schedule exercise class find peep gym closure put bump soon could right back certain degree accountability class people miss also find class absolutely love old health club membership include one session personal trainer create plan sort floor machine learn use machine hate class thing include water aerobics finally weigh every obsess weight never want weight get away help understand normal fluctuation say practice none habit change gradual change roll believe time different believe could donate clothe long period lose read today probably good thing plateaus actually change weight set point discourage happen fact yesterday break plateau lose gain damn pound work loss also slow gain muscle definitely small weight loss fat loss thing learn weight health still fat obese bmi measure metabolically healthy health concern accord doctor look number pretty perfect include blood pressure cholesterol blood sugar focus health balanced diet food fill body healthy food move body overall health number although exercise helpful weight loss kind forgiving,"['today', 'donate', 'fat', 'clothe', 'title', 'say', 'today', 'donate', 'fat', 'clothe', 'last', 'almost', 'year', 'lose', 'pound', 'pant', 'maybe', 'large', 'size', 'shirt', 'maybe', 'large', 'know', 'still', 'big', 'butt', 'wear', 'regular', 'size', 'still', 'goal', 'point', 'get', 'yoe', 'whole', 'life', 'clothe', 'donate', 'today', 'one', 'fit', 'lose', 'last', 'time', 'big', 'basically', 'diet', 'huge', 'weight', 'previous', 'attempt', 'different', 'time', 'diet', 'yes', 'eat', 'eat', 'calorie', 'burn', 'low', 'carb', 'keto', 'restriction', 'kind', 'eat', 'slight', 'calorie', 'deficit', 'eat', 'anything', 'taste', 'always', 'simply', 'add', 'food', 'log', 'good', 'bad', 'food', 'anything', 'moderation', 'menu', 'habit', 'change', 'habit', 'eat', 'basically', 'mediterranean', 'diet', 'meal', 'plan', 'usually', 'meal', 'prep', 'always', 'know', 'eat', 'fruit', 'usually', 'snack', 'wash', 'ready', 'eat', 'chocolate', 'drink', 'water', 'unsweetene', 'tea', 'iced', 'hot', 'lemon', 'juice', 'breakfast', 'coffee', 'little', 'cream', 'schedule', 'exercise', 'class', 'find', 'peep', 'gym', 'closure', 'put', 'bump', 'soon', 'could', 'right', 'back', 'certain', 'degree', 'accountability', 'class', 'people', 'miss', 'also', 'find', 'class', 'absolutely', 'love', 'old', 'health', 'club', 'membership', 'include', 'one', 'session', 'personal', 'trainer', 'create', 'plan', 'sort', 'floor', 'machine', 'learn', 'use', 'machine', 'hate', 'class', 'thing', 'include', 'water', 'aerobics', 'finally', 'weigh', 'every', 'obsess', 'weight', 'never', 'want', 'weight', 'get', 'away', 'help', 'understand', 'normal', 'fluctuation', 'say', 'practice', 'none', 'habit', 'change', 'gradual', 'change', 'roll', 'believe', 'time', 'different', 'believe', 'could', 'donate', 'clothe', 'long', 'period', 'lose', 'read', 'today', 'probably', 'good', 'thing', 'plateaus', 'actually', 'change', 'weight', 'set', 'point', 'discourage', 'happen', 'fact', 'yesterday', 'break', 'plateau', 'lose', 'gain', 'damn', 'pound', 'work', 'loss', 'also', 'slow', 'gain', 'muscle', 'definitely', 'small', 'weight', 'loss', 'fat', 'loss', 'thing', 'learn', 'weight', 'health', 'still', 'fat', 'obese', 'bmi', 'measure', 'metabolically', 'healthy', 'health', 'concern', 'accord', 'doctor', 'look', 'number', 'pretty', 'perfect', 'include', 'blood', 'pressure', 'cholesterol', 'blood', 'sugar', 'focus', 'health', 'balanced', 'diet', 'food', 'fill', 'body', 'healthy', 'food', 'move', 'body', 'overall', 'health', 'number', 'although', 'exercise', 'helpful', 'weight', 'loss', 'kind', 'forgiving']",274,post,nfi1lb

I still have about 11lbs to lose until i’m exactly where i want to be but i’ve proved to myself i can get to this point so that next 11lbs won’t be far away!

I have a picture on my phone which reads:

“if you quit now, you’ll be right back where you first began. And when you first began, you were desperate to be right where you are now. Keep going”. It always keeps me motivated and i want more people to keep this in mind when days get tough or the scales are stubborn.

1i3zajj,The_Little_Bot,It was in the mid 500s 6 months ago. This is the lowest it's ever been. 🎉🎉🎉,"It all started 6 months ago when I had a tooth pulled. I was prescribed some steroids. I thought I was having some kind of allergic reaction because day 1 after the medication I felt really itchy all over my body but no hives. Day 2 the itching was worse and my heart rate felt elevated, I found some blood in my stool and threw up a few times but I let it ride. 

Day 3 I woke up and was heaving really badly. I drove to work in a daze but didn't think it was worth calling in over. I get to work and everyone said I looked awful. I was bright red, breathing was still very laboured and heart was still racing. Then I felt incredibly irritable which is very out of character for me. My manager told me to go home and get some help which was wild because they rarely do that. First, I went to the dentist up the road to explain what was happening and asked about the medication they prescribed me. They took my BP and said it was really high and they would recommend I go to the ER immediately. I'm very stubborn and didn't have insurance so I thought I'd go home, take an epsom salt soak, a Benadryl and a nap and see if it was the allergic reaction I was rationalizing it to be. My partner got off of work about 4 hours after I got home and I realized I almost couldn't breathe at all so I agreed he could take me to an ER. 

By the time we got checked in I was feeling like I was going to pass out and the waiting room was packed. They called me back in a few mins and the next thing I know I'm getting hooked up to all of these fluids and put in a cardiac ICU. Took them a couple of days to get me stable but I was so out of it I only remember sleeping a lot. They said if I hadn't gone in when I did I would have gone comatose. Anyway they said my A1C was 15.5 but was probably higher, that was just as high as their scale went. My blood glucose was 536. They said I was severely diabetic and had probably been diabetic for a very long time and just never caught it. 

So I embarked on the journey. I decided to use some my FMLA and take a couple of extra weeks off from work to research, establish a primary care Dr., buy reading materials, revamp my fridge and pantry, get a nutritionist, meal plan, join communities, etc. I knew nothing about diabetes going into this but I got scared straight in the ER. 

After 2 months I got my A1C down to 11.5 and after 3 months 9.5. the Dr. seemed very impressed with my progress and said I won't be on insulin much longer if I keep at it. I dropped about 30 lbs in 3 months with meds, diet and exercise. When I went last though they told me I lost too much weight and needed to try to put 10lbs back on. The kicker is that I couldn't afford to get my insulin refilled for the last month and a half. So I've just been riding the other medications and minding my diet because I've also been too embarrassed to admit I haven't been able to refill the insulin. Even with all my hard work and being in 2000 mg of metformin a day my blood glucose was still hovering 190-230ish. But I managed to get it to the early 100s these last couple of weeks, then hit 101 today and it's been staying there!

 I am going to go back to the Dr. next weekend to get my A1C checked again, explain the insulin situation and reassess my medications since they are getting low. But heck. I'm very proud to see it staying around 100. I know this was a very long tldr and I am sure I've been fumbling here or there but I'm feeling confident I can get where I need to be and maintain it.

1mtmh4h,17mommyfieri,Weight Loss & Diabetes,"In 2021, I was diagnosed with diabetes with an A1C of 12.7. I was over 330 pounds, and my pregnancy was incredibly difficult because of diabetes. My baby ended up in the NICU, and I almost didn’t make it.

After that, I knew I had to change. I went through weight loss surgery, started working with a mental health focused nutritionist, and began the hard process of rebuilding my life.

Today, I’m down 130 pounds, my A1C is 4.7, and I’m only on one medication. That feels amazing to say, even though the journey is far from over.

It hasn’t been easy. I’ve had a really difficult time with my mental health through all of this. I went through a divorce, experienced sexual violence, survived a suicide attempt, and lost the support system I thought I could lean on. There were so many days where I felt like giving up, but I didn’t. I kept going for myself and for my child.

My next goal is to keep working on my health and start training for a 5K. I just need to save up for running gear, so if you have recommendations, I’d love them.

What I’ve learned is that change is possible. It takes putting yourself first, holding tight to your “why,” and being gentle with yourself through the hard days. Celebrate the wins, even the small ones, and know that you’re still moving forward no matter how heavy life feels.

1kmg7o1,bubblegumpunk69,My A1C is 5.1!!!!,"I’m so happy 😭 a few months ago I was in diabetic distress eating whatever I wanted. Now, I’m as close to remission as one can get with this disease, and I’m being taken off of metformin!! I just needed to share. I’m so fucking proud of myself 


EDIT: a few people have asked me about how I got here, but Reddit wouldn’t let me respond to them, so here’s what I tried to type:


Hello!! This is a late response cause I got overwhelmed lol but I wanted to share still.



I walk after every meal. It actually isn’t usually a “real” walk- I’ll put a show or YouTube video on the tv and walk back and forth while it plays for 10-15 minutes. After that, I’m allowed to sit down again. I also try to go for a walk every single day, though, for at least an hour. I try to hit 10k steps as many days as I can, and unless I’m really sick or something, I don’t allow myself to go under 5k steps per day. 


That’s the bulk of my exercise, but I do also go to the gym occasionally. I’m working my way up (anxiety) to doing things like weights, but for now, I just do ~40 minutes of cardio on a bike or elliptical. I do this about 3 times a week. At home, I have a few 10lb weights that I use a couple times a week. I just do things like bicep curls, hammer curls, and lateral raises in my room.


I also dance frequently when bored!! Nothing serious lol. I literally just put on some music and do a little boogie in my room by myself. I’d also count cleaning as exercise, honestly- I deep clean my bathroom and kitchen once a week and it’s quite a workout.




As for food, I’m on what I consider a modified version of keto. My main nutrition goals are to get fibre and protein, and I don’t worry too much about fats if they’re coming from balanced and varied sources (i.e. I don’t eat a lot of bacon even though it fits into a keto diet well). 90% of my carbs come in the form of vegetables. In my own head I call what I do the High Pro-File Diet lol. When I look down at my dinner plate, the goal is for it to be half to two-thirds high fibre vegetables and one half to one-third protein, with fats in both. I use a medium sized dinner plate for lunch and breakfast, and supplement with snacks throughout the day. Breakfast varies based on my previous day of eating and what I feel I need to start the day. 



Common meals include: bunless hot dogs (look at the nutrition labels for carbs though, some brands are surprisingly high in them) served with sauerkraut and mustard, pot roast, chicken thighs marinated in yogurt and spices and then roasted in the oven, cruciferous vegetables (primarily broccoli and brussel sprouts) roasted in olive oil and spices, low sugar yogurt with berries, sandwiches made with carbonaut bread (I trust this brand, but I also only have 2-4 slices of it a week), quesadillas made with low carb tortillas (brands and results vary, so this is once again something I’ll only have like once a week, OR I’ll make a half moon instead of a full moon and serve it with a side of veggies), non-breaded buffalo wings with veggies and blue ranch, and a whole bunch more. With something like the chicken wings and veggies, while you usually would see a lot of wings to a few veggies on a plate in a restaurant, I swap it around so that it matches my plate rule.


There are a lot of easy ways to make foods you love diabetes-safe. I grew up eating cabbage rolls, but those are typically carb heavy with the rice, and with tomato sauces that sometimes have added sugar. Some people might choose to replace it with something like cauli rice, but honestly? I don’t like the water content it adds and usually just omit the rice altogether. Finding recipes that work in a low carb way can take trial and error sometimes, but there’s almost always a way to do it. 



I am a very snacky person, which has always been one of my issues. Some snacks that I allow myself to have with little to no restrictions are: olives, pickles, boiled eggs and devilled eggs, and veggies with dip (being sure to pick low carb ones ofc). Ones that I have *some* restrictions on because they’re still not great for you in other ways are: beef jerky and meat sticks (always double check the nutrition label for carbs), nuts (which are ofc very good for you, they’re just also super high calorie), low sugar yogurt cups (they’re low sugar not no sugar), and cheese strings (these are only in this category instead of the low restrictions one because I *will* eat an entire bag of them in one sitting). 



There are also Cheat Snacks. These aren’t real cheats, but I log them that way in my head because it helps me avoid actually cheating on my diet. I am allowed to have 2-3 of these a week, unless I’m on my period, at which point I allow myself up to one a day for the sanity of myself and everyone around me lol. These are primarily no sugar added chocolate bars, no sugar added gummies, no sugar added ice cream, and Quest Chips. Sometimes you just really need to fill the junk void. Always check the nutrition label and ingredients on these. They can be sneaky with carb sometimes, but you also want to keep an eye out for certain sweeteners—primarily malitol and anything that ends in “ulose”—because they’ll make you poop your pantaloons if you’re not careful. 



Ofc, you also need to live your life. I have certain foods and days that I’m allowed to *actually* cheat on. I can have a treat on every holiday. Most of the time, just one- the exceptions are my birthday, Halloween, and Christmas. I can go a little crazier on those days. When I go the movie theatre, I’m always allowed to have a bit of popcorn. Once a month I can also have a *real* cheat meal- you learn a lot about what’s worth it to you by doing that. There are exceptions of course. I’m generally strict, but if my family is going to McDonald’s while on a long drive, I can get the dang McDouble and not count it towards my monthly cheat if I really want to. As long as it doesn’t happen frequently, it’s okay. I don’t gotta torture myself with nothing but a Diet Coke in the car while everyone around me eats McNuggets and Quarter Pounder’s. 



On that note: restaurants usually aren’t actually that hard. A lot of places have non-breaded wings, and if they do they have buffalo sauce. If they sell burgers, they’ll let you get it with no bun if you ask. If they have salads, try to get one with a mayo or yogurt based dressing rather than something like a vinaigrette, and avoid dried fruits. The only places I really struggle with are Italian restaurants and things like Chinese takeout. AYCE sushi is a great option if you like raw fish, but usually only for dinner, because lunch often doesn’t have sashimi. 



Foods I avoid are the usuals- pasta, pastries, sweets, rice, noodles, potatoes etc. Even when I allow myself to eat carbs and have a cheat meal, it doesn’t usually include these. 90% of the time I’d rather have a good fried chicken sandwich if I’m breaking my diet. If I’m out with family or close friends for dinner and they order one of these, though, I might ask for a single bite to try. The only food I nearly *fully* restrict is pasta. It sucks. I love pasta lol. But when most people eat it their 1 plate is usually like 4-6 servings, and even one actual serving spikes me so high that I stay up peeing all night. It just isn’t worth it. I would break this rule for two things: incredibly high quality fresh pasta, OR a really good baked mac n cheese. This part is specific to me, and what spikes me might not spike someone else.

1o0r3hn,Beginning_Bear5307,30+ Years of T2 Diabetes,"TL:DR:  I've been a T2 diabetic for over 30 years now.  This post is just to share some of what I've learned along the way and hopefully offer some support and reassurance for those newly diagnosed who are scared and confused.

I first learned I was T2 diabetic in 1993 or 1994.  It was a routine check-up.  I'd been feeling fine and told the doctor I was great.  I was losing weight without even trying and drinking lots of water.  I was also getting up multiple times a night to pee and drinking huge glasses of water because I was so thirsty.  My vision was also a bit blurry.  But I was young, thought I was invincible, and didn't think much of these things.

My doctor was smart enough to put 2 & 2 together based on my symptoms and tested my blood sugar.  I no longer remember exactly what it was -- but something in the 400s.  I couldn't believe it when he said I had diabetes.  I reacted probably much the same way many of you did -- I was confused and terrified.

A lot has changed since then.  The Internet wasn't what it is now -- and there was no asking ChatGPT for ideas or getting opinions from Reddit.  CGMs didn't exist, and many of the newer meds hadn't been developed yet.  He put me on metformin and a sulfonylurea (don't remember which one).  The metformin gave me terrible diarrhea, and if you're not familiar with sulfonylurea, they can cause your blood sugar to go too low.  This was a new experience for me -- getting low blood sugars.  I'd start sweating, getting light-headed, and desperately craving sweets.  It seems like such a long time ago when I think back on it now.

I see a lot of postings here from folks who are newly diagnosed, scared, and searching for answers.  I wanted to create this posting to share some of what I've learned over my 30+ year journey.

First and foremost, get the immediate threat stabilized.  For T2, that would typically mean high -- as in really high numbers.  High blood sugars are largely a long-term threat -- they're only an immediate threat if they're really high.  How high is really high?  I can't say -- not a doctor.  But you may already know if you ended up in the ER for some reason.  I was having no symptoms beyond what I mentioned when I tested in the 400s.  Many people have T2 and don't even know it -- this is why.  It's a silent, long-term killer.  Knowing you have it -- now you can take steps to manage it and improve your chances of living a long life.

Once you've addressed that, take a deep breath.  All the emotions you're feeling are normal -- we've all gone through it.  T2 diabetes isn't a death sentence -- but it does require you to take care of yourself in ways that maybe you haven't before.  I ate a terribly unhealthy diet, and it was tough to change.  But start by learning all you can about it and know what the risks are.  Immediate dangers come in the form of blood sugars being too low or too high.  Long-term risks are many -- blindness, amputation, kidney failure, etc.  It's scary, but again, not a death sentence.  You just have to take care of yourself.

Some of my personal tips for long-term success:

Find the right balance for you in terms of diet, medication, and exercise.  Can you go on a rigid diet and intense exercise program and get yourself into remission?  Yes, it may be possible.  I did it once.  But again, remember, it's a marathon.  You have to be able to maintain this lifestyle forever.  I was doing a low-carb, calorie-deficit diet and exercising upwards of two hours a day.  I felt great and my numbers were awesome -- but in the end, I couldn't sustain it over the long term.  If you can -- that's awesome and I congratulate you.  I just wasn't able to.

Learn about the different treatment options available.  Metformin has been around forever and is still the first-line treatment.  Doctors still, and I have no idea why, prescribe 2000mg or 2500mg (and not the ER version) right out of the gate.  This can lead to highly unpleasant digestive issues, including stomach pain and diarrhea.  Some people are never able to tolerate it, although, for me, I did much better after moving to ER and titrating up slowly.  To this day, I still take 1500mg ER daily.  My recommendation is to go for ER right off the bat -- there's no downside as far as I know.  Start wth 500 and see how it goes.  If no issues, then move up from there.  You can go up to 2000 on ER.

After metformin, there are lots of other options.  Learn about them and ask your doctor.  GLP-1s are all the rage now, and they are pretty amazing.  I took both Ozempic and Mounjaro for a while.  But there are risks, and you need to understand them.  These drugs are pretty new -- and the long-term effects are not yet known.  But there are other newer options too.  Some of them have additional benefits - like protecting from heart disease.  I'm not going to make sales pitches for anything.  What's best for one person might not be for someone else.  Do your homework and ask questions when you see your doctor.

Invest in a CGM.  Maybe your insurance will cover it -- which is nice.  Mine doesn't, so I buy my own Stelo monitors.  Even if you can't or don't want to do this long-term, you should do it for a while.  CGMs are awesome to help you understand how food affects you, what things you can eat freely and the things you need to eat in moderation.  Once you have a better understanding, you don't have to always wear one if you don't want to and have your numbers controlled.  For many years, the only option I had was finger-sticking -- which is not fun, and doesn't give you nearly as much information.

See your eye doctor \*every\* year.  Do this religiously.  Diabetic retinopathy is a long-term complication of diabetes that can lead to blindness.  As long as it's caught early, it can be treated -- but if you ignore your eyes, develop it, and it goes untreated -- you can go blind.  I've never missed an appointment in 30+ years.  I was recently diagnosed with mild NPDR, which is the initial stage of diabetic retinopathy.  It's very early, and I don't even need to do anything yet other than make sure my blood sugars are controlled.  If it worsens, they are treatments available.  The key is that I caught it early.  I saw a retina specialist and he said I'll never go blind in my lifetime as long as I stay on top of it.

Don't fall into the habit of ""out of sight, out of mind.""  It's easy to just forget about your diabetes and pretend it's not there.  This is another one of the benefits of wearing a CGM -- it's much harder to ignore.

You may never again be able to eat the way you have in the past.  With that said, it doesn't mean that you have to (or even should) give up everything you love.  Life is a balance, and so is this illness.  Everyone is different, and you have to figure out what works for you.  However, I still have treats sometimes.  No, I can no longer just go crazy with cake and donuts and (insert your favs here), but I can still enjoy treats with moderation.

That's about it.  I hope someone finds this information helpful.

1iwjt2y,FarPomegranate7437,Rant: I’m tired of the carb police,"Let me start this out by saying that I appreciate all the wonderful advice that people have given on this sub. It is invaluable to learn about people’s different experiences when trying to navigate t2 diabetes.

That being said, there are some people on this sub who immediately will either advise people to stop eating carbs or criticize people when they do. I am tired of this kind of response because 1. not all carbs are equal, 2. not all carbs are bad, 3. they key to living with diabetes as so many of the wonderful people here have pointed out is sustainability, 4. not everyone metabolizes food in the same way. Immediately jumping the gun and pointing out that people have made egregious mistakes eating carbs lacks nuance and can be extremely dangerous for some.

Yes, as a diabetic, I know that certain carbs are going to raise my bg with little benefit and possible harm to my body. However, eating balanced meals is important. Carbs are in pretty much everything except for meat. If I want to eat 200g of spaghetti squash with a red sauce instead of a bowl of pasta I will still be ingesting 25g of carbs from the tomatoes, squash, and whatever minimal toppings I add like pre-shredded mozzarella (used for convenience) or nutritional yeast. Yet 25g of carbs from this meal may cause a very different kind of elevation than the 3 breaded chicken wings I had that were a total of 15g of carbs. The potato starch on the wings and the added sugars in the sauce cause an elevation similar to the spaghetti squash I had for lunch with the difference of nutritional content and my feelings of satiety after a meal. I may also metabolize the same food completely differently depending on my sleep, hydration, hormones, stress, etc.

What many good people are and have been doing is recommend that people really be conscientious about their diets and reduce carbs from starchy foods and added sugars in a way that is both healthy and sustainable. And what these good people repeatedly say is to eat to your meter, meaning to know how your body will react to certain foods and to manage accordingly. Diabetes is an incredibly individualized disease, and while carb intake is one way of managing our bg, it is only a part of the lifestyle change that needs to happen to successfully manage the disease.  

While we’re at it, I love hearing success stories on this sub! I also love hearing the positivity and the support people have to offer others when they’re feeling down or going through diabetes-related burnout. What I don’t love is when people foist their unrealistic goals of being 70-120mg/dl all the time or going so low carb they come out with a 4.x A1c on others, especially those who are new or struggling to manage. It is definitely more destructive than it is helpful. This is how you break people to the point when they just want to give up. I am all for people talking about what works for them, but I wish that it wasn’t written like it was scientifically proven fact. (Granted, perhaps it is problematic that many of us do come to the internet for advice instead of relying on the knowledge of the medical field - and I don’t just mean doctors or nutritionists but also peer-reviewed scientific research and publications. However, that is the nature of technology these days.)

Sorry for the long-winded rant! I think that education about food, diet, and exercise is so important and some of the people, especially those who have been managing t2 for years and decades, have been so informative and realistic.

1fzdskm,joshss22,Progress one year in,"One year today since my initial diagnosis. I have made tremendous progress, and would like to share what I’ve been doing.

Diet: 
I mostly stick to high protein and low carb. A typical day includes 120g of lean protein, less than 50g of total carbs and around 30g net at most, and try to incorporate avocado or fatty fish in one meal a day. I’m not picky about fats, but it does round out my diet to around 1500-1800 calories a day.  

Meds:
2mg ozempic a week
500mg ER Metformin a day
1000U fish oil a day
2 heaping tablespoons of psyllium husk fiber a day. 

Exercise: 
30 minutes almost every day (even if just walking) 
Mostly I try to alternate days between zone 3ish intensity cardio and then weight or resistance training. For example one day bike riding for speed, next day running in the pool, next day rowing on the lake, next day lifting weights. For resistance I’ve always gone for more reps rather than higher weight. One word of advice here…at first exercise would increase my blood glucose. Over time this went away, just stick with it. 

Results: 
A1C 8.9 to 4.8
Fasting glucose 198 to 73
Weight l 350 to 200
Triglycerides 281 to 59 
HDL 17 to 55
LDL  150 to 50

Instantly turned my life around. Started metformin, almost fully eliminated carbs, reduced portion sizes, exercise at least 5 days a week, and lost 105 pounds (and counting!)

Got checked yesterday and I hit an A1C of 5.1. Also had a full bloodwork screen and everything else is damn near the middle of the good range. 

100% a self serving brag post but whatever, I earned it. Now if you’ll excuse me, I’m going to go stare at a picture of a pizza while I eat some broccoli.

mlglrp,eradicATErs,Just got latest test results. a1c from 18.9 to 4.9 in 9 months.,"I am a constant lurker but, last May I was diagnosed with type 2. I had been sick for aver a year, throwing up and just not right. Each doc thought the other was running simple blood tests. Finally after almost 3 years and many gastro procedures it was identified as type two. My blood sugar was sitting at 332. The doc put me on Xeduo and sent me home. 48 hours later I had thrown up 37 times and was on floor of bathroom when I called and the emergency department said get here now. When I checked in my blood sugar was 812 and my A1c was 18.9 with potassium well under 1.80. I was in severe DKA and was told they didn't know how I walked in and how I wasn't gone already. I fell into a diabetic coma and don't remember much over the next few days.

The doctor had told my wife to make sure affairs were in order and that had I just fell asleep I would have been gone for sure. When he came into my room on day 4 he was amazed to find me speaking to him and bluntly said he didn't except me to be speaking again. That was a shock. I was 286 pounds, would eat whatever/whenever to the extreme. I would finish a bag of candy and two yogurts and 4 slices of bread and two hamburgers just to do it. 

Fast forward to today I am 198 pounds and just got my test results back. A1c sitting at 4.9, bloodsugar range over the past year is sitting at 116 average and only out of zone 5 or 6 times. The doctor cant find any diabetic proteins in my urine. I do pushups everyday. Almost all day honestly. Started with 3 then 6 then 10 then 25 at a time. I now do close to 200 a day. I have changed my diet so drastically I am basically a vegetarian now and feel amazing. The main thing I have found is , it doesn't matter what you eat but how much. If you want a skittle great. Have 1 or two not a bag. If you want a chicken stir fry, great, eat 1/3rd what you normally would. limiting the intake is key for me. I keep carbs under 30 per meal or snack. I graze constantly but will do ten to twenty pushups randomly as often as I can. Also Water, More water than I thought a person could drink.

I am on 1.2mg of victoZa a day down, from 1.8 and have started having slight swings from 70s to 180s but still well within range. I am super happy and proud of myself. 

I almost died and it was super scary, knowing how truly close I was haunts me. I still am terrified honestly but know I can keep it up.

1o7vyls,temperedolive,"Seriously, check your feet!","I'm very grateful to be the people in this sub who warned me to check my feet daily and so I'm passing on the message!

A couple of days ago, I found a tiny hard bump in my heel. About the size of a pinhead. It's painless and I can't feel it when walking,  so I wouldn't notice it unless I was actively checking. I went to the doctor today, and it's a corn.

It needs to be removed, because a corn can ulcerate. And because it was discovered so small and at such an early stage, I can treat it at home with urea lotion to soften it and let it slough. I won't need to have anything invasive done that could lead to nerve damage in my foot or infection of a surgical site. 

So absolutely check. And if you find anything that you don't understand, even if it's painless and seems minor, get it checked by a professional.

Feb 20 @ 11.6

May 6 @ 6.0

June 8 @ 4.8! 

First 2.5 months I was on Mounjaro + Metformin. After 6.0 follow up I was taken off Metformin since my Dr said Mounjaro was doing the heavy lifting between the two medications and I had good bg control. 

Mounjaro makes it a lot easier for me to eat like a normal, healthy person. I move more than I did previously and meet regularly with a dietician. Trying to incorporate more strength training but I don't love it yet. Still haven't made it into a habit.

I don't shy away from occasional full desserts. Most nights I have a couple skinny dipped dark chocolate peanut butter cups to satisfy my sweet tooth. I eat carbs, just no longer in excess and usually the healthier kinds. Snacks are mostly protein forward, but I'm not overly strict. 

I was so certain my A1C of 6 last month was being skewed higher by my out of control bg in the month where I was first diagnosed and starting medications. I was doing finger pricks for the last 2 months and estimated I was averaging around 95 mg/dl and decreasing, so this result has really made my week.

1lnpbzm,Formal_Coyote8842,"Diagnosed in February with an A1C of 13.9, Now at 6.2!","As the title says, I was diagnosed type 2 diabetes back in February. I didn't have a family doctor at the time, so I went to a walk in clinic and honestly had a horrible experience.The doctor looked at my bloodwork, told me I was diabetic gave me zero info on how to manage it, and just told me to “lose weight and eat better.” then he tossed me prescriptions for metformin and gliclazide and walked out. That was it. 

Needless to say, I spiraled a little bit. I went through a depressive episode and felt completely lost. Thankfully, I have amazing best friends who saw how lost I was and put together a weeks worth of diabetic friendly meals and snacks for me. That simple act of love was the turning point. It helped me realize I needed to take this seriously. 

I started tracking my carb intake, became way more aware of what I was putting in my body, and quit vaping. I also started taking my prescriptions seriously. Gliclazide, unfortunately, made my vision super blurry so I stopped taking it for a while. Even without it I found I was able to manage my blood sugar just with diet and exercise. I try to go for a couple hours walk every day. 

Lately I've been struggling financially, so my diet hasn't been the greatest, so I started taking my prescriptions again to help stabilize things. In the mean time I made it my mission to find a family doctor and I finally did! He ordered bloodwork to get a better understanding of where I’m at and he was shocked when he saw how much progress I’ve made. My A1C dropped from 13.9 to 6.2 since February! He even had to double check he had the right file. 

Long story short: I’m proud of myself. I’m now within the pre-diabetic range, and it feels like all my hard work is paying off. I’m doing the best I can with the hand I was dealt and honestly that's all any of us can do.

1jalupf,medicalcinable,"I Let Myself Go, and Now I’m Facing the Consequences","I was diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes about five years ago. When I first got the news, I fought hard—I completely changed my diet, stayed on top of my numbers, and managed to bring my A1C down from 10% to 6.1%. I held onto that control for about two years, and for a while, I felt like I had this disease under control.

But then… life happened. Stress, bad habits, excuses—I don’t even know exactly when or how it started—but I slowly let go of everything I worked for.

For the past three years, I’ve been eating whatever I wanted. I rarely checked my blood sugar, and honestly? I think my body just adapted to living in a high blood sugar state. No symptoms. No immediate consequences. Just silent damage happening in the background.

Today, I finally checked my fasting blood sugar, and it hit 262 mg/dL—the highest I’ve ever seen. And even though I knew it was going to be bad, seeing that number still hit me like a ton of bricks.

I feel horrible. Disgusted with myself. I knew better, and I still let this happen. I know the risks. I know the damage this disease can do. And yet, I ignored it.

I don’t even know why I’m posting this. Maybe I just need accountability or a reminder that I’m not alone in this. I feel completely isolated right now, and I guess I just needed to put this out there.

Couple of replacements that have helped me with food stuffs:   Polar Seltzers, way better then Lacroix for the soda fiends.    Whole Grain Pasta for when I want it, makes a mean mac n cheese too.     Fair life milk is great and way less sugar and fat in my morning tea.     I cannot do any of the sugar substitutes, they all wreck my gut so I had to basically cold turkey in that area.   Pork Loin and Smoked Turkey has been a VERY nice replacement meat for the heavy red meat diet I had prior.   Ninja Creami has been a dream as well to replace my sherbert addiction, fresh fruit sorbet's with a little heavy cream are pretty darn good and last a while under major portion control.

Lime juice as a sweetener in my iced tea.  Southern guy and moving to unsweet tea and fresh squeeze lime juice wasn't as terrible as I expected (I still miss sweet tea lol).

Walk 30 minutes a day, rain, sun, wind, whatever, gotta do it.

I thought I could save her but I couldn’t. Because she lived with it. Before she went to the doctor she started to feel fatigue and get rapid heartbeats whenever she tried to walk. It started to get worse and after two weeks. She couldn’t walk and I had to bring her a diabetes doctor. She gave her an a ringer’s inject IV drip in artery. She prescribed Galvusmet ( metformin medication) 100 ml every 12 hours.


I remember that day, I stay home from work and I tried to give mom food. She ate yogurt, cucumber, soup and refused to eat anything else. I gave her the medication as described. Mom asked me if she should take half or all the pill . I told her the doctor said the whole pill. She slept but was so worried and she told me she had stomach ache and then she woke up and tried to walk to the bathroom. I went there and got her out and she started to take her last breaths and her heart stopped.


I’m all alone in life. Extended family want to sell the house I used to live in. ( heritage) 

I miss mom and I miss feeling safe. I wish I could help her. I didn’t. I wish I recognized the symptoms… I just hope the medication wasn’t the reason she died. Because she trusted the doctor that I got. I’m going through a hard time and every time, I miss her and I regret everything. I regret not measuring her blood sugar before giving her the second pill. I don’t even know if it was low or high blood sugar that caused her heart to stop….

Also, unfortunately, mom blamed me for her diabetes right after she knew she had it. She told me I stressed her out. Now I feel terrible and I just can’t deal with grief well. My entire body burns thinking about it.  I wish mom did blood tests earlier.

1mee293,Neither_Benefit_2289,How Diabetes Changed My Life,"Diagnosed in January 2025 (M57 – A1C 10.5), I’ve brought my A1C down to 5.6 since then.

* I received absolutely no explanation, guidance, or support from my doctor—just a “no sugar, good luck” kind of approach. He prescribed Metformin (2000mg) and gliclazide (a sulfonylurea), telling me I’d likely need insulin given how high my levels were.
* I spent the first three days in shock, binge-watching videos about diabetic complications with a sort of morbid fascination. In hindsight, I think that actually helped me snap into action.
* It was the videos by Jason Fung and Robert Lustig that helped me completely overhaul my diet from day one—no transition, just a radical shift.
* I used to eat constantly at night, so simply sticking to a 12-hour eating window was a huge challenge at first. I was starving in the morning and counting the minutes until I could have breakfast. Now I’m doing 18/6 intermittent fasting.
* Cutting sugar turned out to be surprisingly easy for me. Every now and then, I’ll have some sugar-free jello or popsicles, but I don’t really miss sweets that much.
* Bread (I used to bake my own and eat it in industrial quantities) and especially chips were the hardest to give up. I’m totally addicted to chips—I’ve had them twice since my diagnosis, but once I start, I can’t stop (I eat like there’s no tomorrow). I’ve decided not to eat them at all anymore because my blood sugar becomes unstable for two days afterward.
* I limit myself to 100g of carbs per day, aiming for 75g to reduce glucose spikes and improve my A1C. Hitting 75g isn’t easy—carbs add up fast when you actually start tracking them.
* My BMI dropped from 26 to 22, a few belt notches down, and I’m now at about the same weight I was at 25. I’m probably in the best cardio shape of my life: 3 hours of biking, 2 hours of strength training, and 5 hours of running per week.
* I had become mostly inactive—a casual runner who struggled during workouts. Losing 25 pounds felt magical; I feel like I’m flying now. I used to struggle to complete 30-minute flat runs; now I can do 2-hour trail runs with elevation.
* Since my doctor couldn’t answer most of my questions, I’ve developed a solid understanding of glucose metabolism—mainly thanks to Ninja Nerd videos and Copilot, which I use like an interactive learning tool (currently diving into cell biology).
* Based on how I feel at room temperature, I’ve gotten pretty good at estimating my blood sugar levels. I feel cold below 90 mg/dL and warm above 115–120.
* Facebook isn’t Reddit demographically. In Facebook groups, I still see intermittent fasting treated like heresy—same with carb restriction.

* I received absolutely no explanation, guidance, or support from my doctor—just a “no sugar, good luck” kind of approach. He prescribed Metformin (2000mg) and gliclazide (a sulfonylurea), telling me I’d likely need insulin given how high my levels were.
* I spent the first three days in shock, binge-watching videos about diabetic complications with a sort of morbid fascination. In hindsight, I think that actually helped me snap into action.
* It was the videos by Jason Fung and Robert Lustig that helped me completely overhaul my diet from day one—no transition, just a radical shift.
* I used to eat constantly at night, so simply sticking to a 12-hour eating window was a huge challenge at first. I was starving in the morning and counting the minutes until I could have breakfast. Now I’m doing 18/6 intermittent fasting.
* Cutting sugar turned out to be surprisingly easy for me. Every now and then, I’ll have some sugar-free jello or popsicles, but I don’t really miss sweets that much.
* Bread (I used to bake my own and eat it in industrial quantities) and especially chips were the hardest to give up. I’m totally addicted to chips—I’ve had them twice since my diagnosis, but once I start, I can’t stop (I eat like there’s no tomorrow). I’ve decided not to eat them at all anymore because my blood sugar becomes unstable for two days afterward.
* I limit myself to 100g of carbs per day, aiming for 75g to reduce glucose spikes and improve my A1C. Hitting 75g isn’t easy—carbs add up fast when you actually start tracking them.
* My BMI dropped from 26 to 22, a few belt notches down, and I’m now at about the same weight I was at 25. I’m probably in the best cardio shape of my life: 3 hours of biking, 2 hours of strength training, and 5 hours of running per week.
* I had become mostly inactive—a casual runner who struggled during workouts. Losing 25 pounds felt magical; I feel like I’m flying now. I used to struggle to complete 30-minute flat runs; now I can do 2-hour trail runs with elevation.
* Since my doctor couldn’t answer most of my questions, I’ve developed a solid understanding of glucose metabolism—mainly thanks to Ninja Nerd videos and Copilot, which I use like an interactive learning tool (currently diving into cell biology).
* Based on how I feel at room temperature, I’ve gotten pretty good at estimating my blood sugar levels. I feel cold below 90 mg/dL and warm above 115–120.
* Facebook isn’t Reddit demographically. In Facebook groups, I still see intermittent fasting treated like heresy—same with carb restriction.
* In the end, without this diagnosis, I was on a downward spiral toward poor eating, obesity, and sedentary life.

1je8lme,rocketplex,I cut my toenails without wirecutters!,"My sugar was probably uncontrolled for a long time, slowly inching it's way towards crisis levels. A couple years ago, it all came to a head when I was admitted to hospital with an infected carbuncle that was hiding in a skin fold. My sugar was 22mmol/L. (About 400mg/dL)

At the time, I was just itchy all over, had been for years. Athletes foot was chronic, my toenails were hideous fungus filled claws. A podiatrist said that they may not be salvageable.

Fast forward 2 years, my sugar is under control at 5mmol/L (90mg/dL) and I've dropped 20kg down to 126kg, not close to where I want to go, but we're on a journey here (the first 10kg was down to me and the next 10kg, thanks to Ozempic). Strangely enough (sarcastic) the itching went down as the sugar levels went down. The itchy feet have been gone for a year (after a blast of anti-fungals) but in the last few months, clear toenails have started slowly pushing my griffon claws out.

This weekend, I clipped my toenails using one hand, didn't have to twist the nail cutter into weird angles and bend my toes in unnatural directions. Best of all, I didn't have to pull out my special pliers to attack my big & little toeclaws while wearing eye protection. I think this is probably the first time I've have mostly clear nails in 10 years. My weight is the lowest it's been in 20 years (It has plateaued, so need to adjust a bit)

I just wanted to brag a bit, but a lot of this came from some tough introspection with myself and building a resilient plan that I can stick to. I have very bad impulse control, I can't resist pizza or cake or chips. So I have to accept that I will occasionally slip and make sure that I put things in place to better my chances of success. It's worked well for two years so far, with the support of an excellent endocrinologist and my own research.

So above the bragging, I wanna shout out that YOU can also do it, know yourself, educate yourself and be real with yourself. You're not perfect so build your plan knowing that you will fail, go on a week long bender, get sick, miss workouts. It's all fine. Just get back on the horse and keep on keeping on.

You're not perfect so build your plan knowing that you will fail, go on a week long bender, get sick, miss workouts. It's all fine. Just get back on the horse and keep on keeping on.

wb4k70,mgmmars,"A1C 9.9 in March, 4.6 today!!!!","Hi everyone! I just want to say that I am super happy and super proud of my progress, and I would not have made it were it not for THIS SUB. When I (35F) was diagnosed back in March it was a godsend in helping me figure out a plan to tackling the mental, emotional and physical sides of the battle. Thank you to this super supportive, super knowledgeable community!!

Here’s what I did, I started taking Janumet (Sitagliptin+Metformin). I cut out carbs and sugar. I eat very close to keto but not quite and not all the time, just mostly…basically eating to my meter as is suggested throughout posts in this sub. I started exercising, walking 3-4 km a couple of days a week and yoga 3-4 days as well. Intermittent fasting 16 hours/day (sometimes 18). I’ve lost just over 21 kg (47 lbs) and have some more to go. After making all these changes I IMMEDIATELY started feeling better, having more energy, having better vision, etc. Next goal is maintaining my current levels, losing another 15-20kg and hopefully being able to go off meds and into remission. 

I credit this community for my early success because although my doctors and dietician were good, the advice they gave me was definitely not as complete or as detailed as I learned going through all the resources here. So, if you’re new and trying to figure stuff out, know that this community has your back, without any judgement and that we are all in the same boat so we understand. Also, although the diagnosis is scary and overwhelming it is possible to manage this condition and live a healthy life.

1mldiwk,temperedolive,I have lost roughly 1/3 of my body weight since diagnosis,"I have always been fat. I don't remember a time when I wasn't. Two pregnancies didn't help (worth it though).

1o3z684,Dezuto,What a great start to this Saturday!,"I was diagnosed last February (I wasn't surprised lol) and Doc told me what comes with it. He said 1/3 of my normal rice consumption, and I'd need to change my lifestyle; be more active since I've got weight to lose. Ok cool. He then asked me if I wanted a perscription to Metformin and potentially Ozempic down the line. I said, ""Nah, I got this.""

So, after my diagnosis, for 1 month, I ate the last normal meals I could before I began the change.
Meal prep, chicken, veggies, an absurd amount of greek yogurt and cottage cheese, and a whole lot of willpower. 

Throughout the months, I saw big changes on the scale, and on the blood work. Friends, family, coworkers, and Doc began to notice. Honestly, this was addicting. But still, I had ways to go.

Fast forward to today. I've made it! On the bloodwork at least. As for my training, I didn't start until late April since I wanted to make sure my diet was in control before strength work. Went from 250 lbs to 200 lbs. Much stronger, look better in clothes. The before pic wasn't 250 lbs, but it's a picture of me I hate as it sums up everything.

Doc never had me monitor my glucose. I asked him if I should, then he asked me if I wanted to because w/ the way I've been progressing, it seemed unnecesary. Ok cool.

I still eat rice (mixed w/ quinoa and lentils for extra volume). I hear chilling rice makes it better for us diabetics. I did this unknowingly due to meal prepping. Pleasant surprise, I guess. Generally, my eating hasn't changed all too much, and the reason for getting diagnosed was most likely because I drank soda like it was water. Now I only drink sugary drinks every once in a while. Soda was replaced by the Zero versions (honestly my cheat code). 

Lastly, I may sound crazy for this, but I think the diagnosis might've been the best thing that's happened to me. It forced me to really look at myself and take control. I have fixed my relationship w/food and brought back the discipline I had lost in college. Now my willpower stat is maxed out. I've still got ways to go, but at least the Diabeetus is behind me now. Big win!
I hope you guys eventually achieve this and feel what I'm feeling. Y'all got this and T2D isn't the end of the world!

TL;DR - Diagnosed w/ T2D, Doc asked if I needed Metformin/Ozempic. I said, ""Nah, I'd win"" - Actually won.

1jd1lj8,swdr0tc0d,One year check-up: A1C from 10.8 to 4.5!,"I forgot to post last month and remembered that I needed to share because this sub was so helpful when I was first diagnosed. So for the newer folks:

Diagnosis was a shock. I was really distraught and mad at myself. Of course, it runs in the family; so I wasn’t exactly being fair to myself either. I immediately made changes to my diet, started on my prescribed Metformin, and began moving more. I was obese, fairly sedentary, and had basically been on a see food diet for years. 

Almost immediately, I started noticing positive changes. Many of my ailments (all, I’d learn, symptoms of my diabetes) started clearing up. Pounds started coming off. By 8 weeks, the A1C was trending in the right direction. 

6 months in, my A1C was already down to 5.1 and I’d lost about 40lbs — about 15% of my body weight. My new doctor got me a glucometer and switched me to Mounjaro to help with the weight loss too. MJ was a game changer. I was so happy to be off the Metformin (the timing of the pills was a real bummer) and quickly got over my fear of shots. 😂 

Today, I’m down about 90lbs — about a third of my starting weight. I took up bouldering as a sport/hobby, and I honestly feel better than at any point I can remember in my life. I’m almost 48 years old and healthier than ever. My diet is also a lot less strict than it was on those early months. Originally, I was as close to no carb as possible. Now, I have been increasing my low glycemic carbs to fuel my body better. A CGM also made a big difference because I learned what foods spiked my blood sugars (white rice with protein, not that bad; honey in any form spikes). And with the exception of a bite of something every now and then (usually from one of my kids who wants to share), I basically don’t eat anything with added sugar. 

At this point, I’m *thankful* for my T2D diagnosis. It gave me the wake up call to put in the hard work for myself and for my family. Too often men are socialized to not be open about health issues, so I try to be an open book amongst my friends to destigmatize and demystify this disease just a little. 

Anyway, I hope this message lands on someone who needs it. Keep on keeping on.

Diagnosis was a shock. I was really distraught and mad at myself. Of course, it runs in the family; so I wasn’t exactly being fair to myself either. I immediately made changes to my diet, started on my prescribed Metformin, and began moving more. I was obese, fairly sedentary, and had basically been on a see food diet for years. 

Almost immediately, I started noticing positive changes. Many of my ailments (all, I’d learn, symptoms of my diabetes) started clearing up. Pounds started coming off. By 8 weeks, the A1C was trending in the right direction. 

6 months in, my A1C was already down to 5.1 and I’d lost about 40lbs — about 15% of my body weight. My new doctor got me a glucometer and switched me to Mounjaro to help with the weight loss too. MJ was a game changer. I was so happy to be off the Metformin (the timing of the pills was a real bummer) and quickly got over my fear of shots. 😂 

Today, I’m down about 90lbs — about a third of my starting weight. I took up bouldering as a sport/hobby, and I honestly feel better than at any point I can remember in my life. I’m almost 48 years old and healthier than ever. My diet is also a lot less strict than it was on those early months. Originally, I was as close to no carb as possible. Now, I have been increasing my low glycemic carbs to fuel my body better. A CGM also made a big difference because I learned what foods spiked my blood sugars (white rice with protein, not that bad; honey in any form spikes). And with the exception of a bite of something every now and then (usually from one of my kids who wants to share), I basically don’t eat anything with added sugar. 

At this point, I’m *thankful* for my T2D diagnosis. It gave me the wake up call to put in the hard work for myself and for my family. Too often men are socialized to not be open about health issues, so I try to be an open book amongst my friends to destigmatize and demystify this disease just a little. 

Anyway, I hope this message lands on someone who needs it. Keep on keeping on.

1nwpot1,Doolcify,Now metformin free :),"I just wanted to put this out as a message of hope for those who are confused and strugglging. Having been diagnosed in the Summer of 2024, with a fasting blood sugar of 300, I am now medication free! This morning my fasting blood sugar wa 80. Sometimes it is as low as 75. While I managed my blood sugar really well with an HbA1c of 4.89, by cutting out sugar, and controlling carbs, and watching for things that caused blood sugar spikes, the real thing that did it was getting my weight back down towards the ideal weight for my body height. I know it might seem impossible, at one point it did for me.

I tried another which was pretty much Gods waiting room. I was the youngest person in there by 30 years and they all had the attitude of “I’m old I’ll do what I want since I’m gonna die soon anyway.”

1l1586o,Firesnowing,Mounjaro is amazing. Talk to your doctor.,"Mounjaro is absolute Wunderwaffe for obesity and diabeetus. I was on 2.5 mg for 3 weeks and my appetite was supressed, probably at 50% of normal. Food noise gone. Like hella gone. No more thinking about food.

Overeating? Gone. Small portion = full as fuck.
Blood glucose levels went from trending 140 to 160 to trending 95 to 110. 

Weight, down 10 elbees in 3 weeks.

I took my first 5mg dose yesterday and food has been warped and bended like space-time through a flux capacitor. A small dose of protein will keep me full for 8 hours. I have to force myself to eat.

The biggest benefit though is the pschological energy. Now that I'm not hungry and thinking about food every damn waking hour, I have thought energy for other things. I'm learning python and building applications that help me at work.

1iz2dh9,Tiny-Bird1543,Potatoes don't have to spike you: My experiment with 5 different cooking methods,"Like many T2Ds, I've been told to avoid potatoes. But I wondered if preparation method could make a difference, so I conducted an experiment testing my glucose response to potatoes prepared five different ways.

Most interesting findings:

* Simply refrigerating boiled potatoes overnight reduced my peak glucose by 23 mg/dL
* Reheating refrigerated potatoes still kept the peak 18 mg/dL lower than fresh
* Adding fat (butter/cream in mashed) reduced the spike compared to plain boiled
* Crispy baked created the highest spike of all methods

For those managing T2D, this suggests that if you occasionally want potatoes, preparing them ahead, refrigerating overnight, and then reheating could significantly reduce the glucose impact.

Has anyone else noticed differences in how cooking affects your response to foods? Any preparation tricks you've discovered?

1ohcerd,No-Frame-7849,Having a positive experience so far and just want to share good vibes on this thread!!,"I did my first shot at .25 last week on Thursday. Traditionally for me, my overeating happens mainly on the weekends when I don't have the structure of the work day. On top of that, I had an 8 hour road trip planned for this past weekend. Another occasion where I would normally snack the whole damn drive and use it as an excuse to eat fast food. In addition to everything mentioned above, I am a coffee addict, love some weed, love a good glass of wine or cocktail, and nicotine. Current nicotine vessel is vaping (i know, none of these habits are great). HOWEVER. 

I was absolutely shocked at the immediate positive impact this has had on me. I had one coffee for the entire 4 hour one way drive (this would easily be a 2-3 coffee situation for me prior). Packed a protein shake, an apple, and some cheese sticks for the drive. More than enough to keep me satisfied. Barely used my vape, which I would normally be hauling on for a long solo drive. And normally would be croaking for a J on this drive, but I was not. 

Got to my hotel at my destination. Ordered a glass of wine. Took over an hour to drink it. Ordered some steak bites for an app. Stuffed half way through. Its like a whole new world.

Only side effect is a mild headache but I always dealt with mild headaches prior to this (probably from excessive coffee drinking LOL). 

All that to say, I feel motivated to quit all of my vices and actually feel like I can.. am I ... about to become an entirely new person?

1ofo1ug,DontStallTheSchoff,"Sort of a weird question about the new Slimfast ""bottles"".

After trying a few different ones out I found I preferred the Slimfast shakes.

So, maybe a month or so ago, they changed the packaging. Instead of a plastic bottle now they're in a laminated cardboard carton with a plastic apron.

Has anyone else who uses them in any capacity as part of their meal plan noticed that most of the stupid things leak out of the bottom of the apron? Normally I try to sip them, but when I get one with a busted apron I end up chugging it.

I also go to the gym. Unfortunately, I tore my rotator cuff 2 weeks ago and the pain medication they have me on has finally ""stabilized""... I want to get up and move around more since my fiance won't let me go to the gym (I am very clumsy and like to push myself so he's worried about me hurting myself more until we know the extent of the tear.. not because he's controlling) I can get to the gym and walk but I do overnights at the moment and I'm on leave from my cleaning job due to no use of my arm 😭 I also have 2 children so finding time for the gym has been hectic unless it's super early in the morning after an overnight or super late on my nights off... 

Anyway, enough of a scenario lol my overnight nursing is in a private facility room. I can't leave my client as she is prone to waking up and falling and we were hired by the family to make sure that doesn't happen. What can I do to get some exercise in? I can do anything on the ground because it triggers fall sensors. I pace back and forth and sometimes walk the hall where I can still see and hear my client if she is asleep. But I feel like that's not enough. 

I'm getting married next year and the scale has gone up and even though I know it's water weight.. it's really bothering me because I worked so hard to get to my goal weight and stay there for 2 years so far. I cut out pop and sugary snacks this week. I can't seem to meet my protein goals since I really don't have much of an appetite but I have upped my water intake and increased my fiber due to the pain medication.

The paper towel effect is real - when I got down to about 200lbs, I still felt and viewed myself exactly as I was at 245lbs and felt rather discouraged. Stuck with it and kept going! As the paper towels started coming off the “roll” my body has transformed more in the last 35lbs than in the first 40 or so that I lost initially on sema.

1odykyh,trixiesecond,Feeling… despondent?,"Per title I’m feeling a bit sad and hopeless. 

I started Wegovy last year and had success slowly dropping about 25kgs. I stopped when we went on holiday as the country we were travelling to was very strict on drugs, and there can be trouble even when you have a prescription, plus I wanted to be able to indulge a little bit. 

Prior to pausing I was losing weight consistently and feeling the effects of blocking out the food noise and desire to binge. 

When we came back I re-started and got incredibly sick with bad bad sulfur burps followed by both vomiting and diarrhoea at the same time for several days. I’d obviously had too long of a break (about 3 weeks) and made a bad choice to just restart where I should have dropped back a dose. 

Since then I’ve had a few false starts but I just can’t get into it. I think because I’m not seeing results instantly (which is an unfair expectation). And because I’m scared of getting sick (def an excuse and my Dr has dropped me back to a lower dose). I’ve gained back about 10kgs.

I do not have any eating/overeating disorders and eat well when I have the time, cooking most of my food, very little processed food, no soda, no binge eating, limited sweets so not sure if I need something to stop me from binging.

My only 'vice' that is effecting weight as far as I can tell is my 2 glasses of red wine a night so I plan on cutting that out to one night per week.

Also getting back into home workouts, dumbbells and heavy-bag workouts.

I would like a booster of sorts so I can combine those and in 8-12 weeks be rid of the weight.

I also FWIW have sleep issues due to the care and am trying to get that back on track too (CBD gummies).

So the question is would either of these help and is so which? I am leaning to the Sermorelin since it seems more in line with working out/muscle gain/lean muscle and even sleep regulation.

Or maybe skip altogether, but wondering if anyone has opinions/thoughts who has used either or both.

Long time lurker here. So as the title suggests, I’m upping my dose from 0.5mg of wegovy to 1mg and for some reason I’m really scared. I feel like I’ve only heard horror stories of people upping to 1mg and above and then just hating their lives.

I’ve had no side effects really, other than constipation but I’ve not really kept up to drinking water like I should (I know I know, but it’s a struggle!).

My weight loss so far has been a bit up and down, but again, I could definitely be doing more in terms of being more active. I kind of struggle with the food structure side of things, as I have AUDHD and find it hard to eat the same thing all the time cause textures just get too much for me and I get a bit bored.

I’ve had no side effects really, other than constipation but I’ve not really kept up to drinking water like I should (I know I know, but it’s a struggle!).

My weight loss so far has been a bit up and down, but again, I could definitely be doing more in terms of being more active. I kind of struggle with the food structure side of things, as I have AUDHD and find it hard to eat the same thing all the time cause textures just get too much for me and I get a bit bored.

Any tips would be much appreciated.

1odfjqn,Feature-Flashy,Semaglutide and Seroquel,"Hey everyone 👋

I’m currently on Seroquel XR 25mg and semaglutide, and while the combo keeps me mentally balanced, I’ve been so groggy and fatigued all day since starting semaglutide. It’s like the XR makes me sedated 24/7 — I’ll sleep fine, but then I’m sluggish all day, barely able to stay productive or even motivated.

I’ve been thinking about switching from Seroquel XR to the immediate-release (IR) version to see if it helps me feel more alert during the day. I’m just nervous that changing the form might mess with my mental stability, because I do rely on Seroquel to keep me grounded.

1ocz7ik,Guilty_Main_9922,Need meal planning/quick meal ideas,"Background:

56 year-old female.  Long history of insulin-resistance symptoms.  I was diagnosed with very high triglycerides in my early 30s.  Managed to lose weight and clean up my numbers through diet and supplements (lipoic acid, chromium, etc). Pregnant in my early 40s and then the dawn of peri menopause, where things really started to go downhill again. I could not stop eating and was exhausted.  Tried a few, very unhealthy, very restrictive diets.  They worked...until they didn't.  I work full-time at a fairly stressful job.

A year ago I started sema at a weight of 176.  Slow and steady, I am now down to 144, and would like to lose 10 more lbs. 

Advice from this sub and my doctor has been invaluable:

\- Initially, I had terrible side effects (vomiting, constipation, diarrhea) when I did belly injections.  Thigh injections were the solution.  I tried moving back to belly a few weeks ago as I seem to have hit a plateau, and I won't be doing that again.

\- I tapered up very very slowly, only getting to a full dose of 2.5 in July.  It doesn't seem as effective as it used to be, but I also need to put in the work.  In the beginning it was easy to just let the meds do the heavy lifting.

I have fallen off the food tracking wagon and my exercise is moderate at best.  I know that I need to get back to doing both of those.

Here is where I would like some help.  The loss of interest in food is great **BUT** I also have lost interest in meal planning so I end up grazing on a narrow combination of foods.  I used to be a ""foodie.""

What are a few go to meals that you have in your pocket that can be prepared quickly and are high in protein?  I don't mind doing some meal prep, but after 3 days of the same lunch, I will time out.

from what i know, the pricing is relatively similar.

i’m wondering prices are similar, what would sway you to one vs the other side? my local clinic is about 20 minutes away but i have the ease of access. i also can talk to my NP, but i know LSH offers this too. i also know that pharmacy matters, so i should ask what pharmacy they use.

1oauh1i,Cheese_is_my_fave,A Break then restart?,"Hello Reddit team,

Everyone here always helpful with their advice, so asking again.

Journey so far:
SW Jan 2024 170lb (ish)
Did 4 months on sema (never got farther than 1mg), lost about 14lb. Stopped due to feeling horrendous on Wegovy, a very bad bout of D&V which lasted for days put me off.

 Regained 10lb.

Started (again!) May 23rd 2025. Did low dose Rybelsus for 2 months, 3mg, then 7mg. Switched to Wegovy pen 1mg again. This time, did not over consume as before, have only had one bout of D&V recently and definitely did just over consume, my own fault. Happy with 1mg, weight loss is v slow but working so fine for me.

Current weight 144lb. Aiming for 130-33ish.

Ok so here's the current situation, and I absolutely know this is going to have me judged for the selfish human being I am lol...

The holiday season is coming up and therefore drinks/food season is coming up. I literally have been on one night out this year since February to a concert and managed to have a few drinks without too much disaster. I have committed to a good few nights out Nov/Dec which involves food/drink. I do miss these social engagements. Talking to someone else on mounjaro they said they just stop taking it for a while if they have a holiday etc coming up, enjoy themselves, then back on it. I know Wegovy is different from mounjaro.

I also have not told a soul I am on this, and feel like I'll be found out straight away on any night out as I am normally all over a good time food and drink wise.

Has anyone else done this? Was thinking of 'quitting' late Nov until Jan 1st (haha, new beginnings again) but don't know if it's wise, possible or if jumping back on at 1mg even sensible. I am also going on a girls holiday in February which will be food and drink oriented.

Is it more sensible to maybe space my shots out more over the holidays eg 1 every 2 weeks instead of each week or lower the dose? 

I don't want to necessarily completely over consume on food, but I would like to be able to enjoy more than 1 drinks without shitting myself. 😆 

Reddit give it to me straight, I am thick skinned so tell me if I'm being ridiculous, what your experience is or what your next move would be.

Wholly aware this is a first world problem of the highest order 😄

I've (34 yo F, 5'4"", SW 236lbs GW?) been taking 0.5 mg/wk since June 21st, and I had lost 12 lbs. Last week, I went to my GP, and she upped my dose to 1 mg/wk. Injection day is Saturday, so I just did week 2 of the higher dosage, but I'm DYING.

I wasn't able to work at all last week because nothing was staying in my body long, and was coming out in liquid form from both ends (sorry, but not as sorry as I am for living it). I literally slept ALL day Tuesday. My GP prescribed me ondanstron, which has helped me keep SOMETHING in, but I'm still dealing with sulfur belching and struggling to eat *anything*. My best friends are all medical professionals, and I'm keeping my GP informed, but I'm feeling really defeated. While I lost 6 lbs this week, if I have another week like this one, there's no way I can continue.

I have PCOS, so this is the first time I've had weight loss results beyond 10 lbs. But again, this isn't a life worth living. If I can't work, can't exercise, can't leave my house, why would I want to keep taking my med?!

I know this was a rant, but does anyone have words of wisdom? Did you struggle with upping your dose this much? How long did it take to get to a functional spot? Did anything help your nausea/ vomiting? TIA ❤️

1oaojcj,FineCryptographer159,Dose increase coming up - apprehensive..,"So I’ve been on 0.25 for 3 weeks and have had minimal side effects so far aside from a bit of a dry mouth on days 3 and 4 post injection and some mild abdominal discomfort. 
I’ve got some appetite suppression and food noise is way down. 
My provider is unable to offer me any in between dose so I have to go straight to 0.5.

My concern is that this seems a big jump and I’ve heard lots of people having quite a hard time with unpleasant symptoms after doing this. 
I’ve got a young toddler and I do shift work at a hospital so I’m just really worried about these side effects causing chaos for my life! 

Is there a way to use the pen to administer a 0.375mg dose even though it’s designed to be 0.5mg? Or is that a bad idea? 
Or in people’s experience should I just stick to 0.25mg for another month to really let my body adjust. 
I’m not in a huge rush to lose weight and only have about 10kg (22lbs) to lose. 

Thanks for your input! 

For reference I’m in the UK and am on Wegovy pens.

It was never necessarily a goal of mine to loose weight, but I knew there must be something that was causing my inability to shed any pounds. 

After semaglutide, I realized how much habitual snacking and drinking I was doing! Also found that I have a gluten intolerance, which was causing a lot of inflammation in my body. All to say, after 8 months I’ve lost 50lbs and have so much more energy!

1l4ewoc,Jealous-Ad9815,Bittersweet Victory,"I find it to be a very bittersweet victory that I can no longer inject my stomach area. I’ve lost over 100 lbs. and considering my weight had been up and down (mostly up) for 20+ years I was expecting the loose skin that I have. It’s not terrible. It’s just fine. But It’s too loose to inject correctly so I have to do it in my leg now. It’s much more painful there since it’s a lot more muscle, but not unbearable. All things considered I don’t think I’ll get surgery to remove the skin. I’m planning to just keep pushing myself and try to keep my skin elastic and hopefully it will get even better over time. Most importantly I am healthy. My BMI is finally just “overweight” and no longer “obese”. And I can’t wait to continue to set a good example for my 2 year old daughter as she grows so quickly.

1kzmm9v,cutelilotters,cheers to 1 year & 70lbs gone!! 🎉🥂,"24f 5’3”, SW: 268.5 (June 2024) , CW: 197.8 (Todqy!) , Total: -70.7lbs 🎉🎊 I also officially joined #onederland this morning!! 

I started sema in June 2024. I have really struggled with my PCOS the past 5 years with only having 1-2 periods a year and rabidly gaining weight. Additionally, my mental heath has never been worse. From bad news from the doctors about the low possibility of ever getting pregnant and a high chance of a diabetes diagnosis, I truly felt like I was in a hole I was never going to be able to get out of. I coped with this by having terrible eating habits & an incredible list of excuses. 

One of my family members was on sema and encouraged me to try. For the first 6 months, the “food noise” difference truly incredible!! I started to slowly work through my mental health issues. I lost 30lbs in the first 6 months. 

Since January 1st, I gave up all fast food/eat healthy homemade meals, sugary drinks (other than the occasional celebratory margarita! 🤪), and doing a workout everyday. I have lost 40 lbs since implementing this consistently in January. I still occasionally eat out at restaurants & am definitely not perfect! I also have gotten my period every month for the past 5 months- the first time since middle school!! 🎉

I started sema in June 2024. I have really struggled with my PCOS the past 5 years with only having 1-2 periods a year and rabidly gaining weight. Additionally, my mental heath has never been worse. From bad news from the doctors about the low possibility of ever getting pregnant and a high chance of a diabetes diagnosis, I truly felt like I was in a hole I was never going to be able to get out of. I coped with this by having terrible eating habits & an incredible list of excuses. 

One of my family members was on sema and encouraged me to try. For the first 6 months, the “food noise” difference truly incredible!! I started to slowly work through my mental health issues. I lost 30lbs in the first 6 months. 

Since January 1st, I gave up all fast food/eat healthy homemade meals, sugary drinks (other than the occasional celebratory margarita! 🤪), and doing a workout everyday. I have lost 40 lbs since implementing this consistently in January. I still occasionally eat out at restaurants & am definitely not perfect! I also have gotten my period every month for the past 5 months- the first time since middle school!! 🎉

And wow, I’m freaking proud of myself!! I truly feel like myself for the first time… ever?? I am fully making a lifestyle change & am excited to keep surprising and challenging myself!

1jo668r,darklordrimjob,game changer,"
I’ve always struggled with binge eating and the only time I was able to maintain a “comfortable” weight was when I was addicted to meth (for 6 years). After going to rehab 3 years ago and getting clean I went back to my old  bad eating habits… one of the hardest things about staying clean, as shallow as it sounds, was looking back on pictures of how my body looked while i was using (I was thin but definitely not healthy!) 
I started Ozempic almost 5 months ago and it has been a game changer. My confidence is back and I feel comfortable in my own skin again. I eat way healthier now that the food noise has quieted down.. I have a labour intensive job so Ive remained active throughout, but it just goes to show how big of a difference choices in diet make!! And my temptation to relapse is 100% gone.

The overall experience has really been positive for me. The weight fell off much faster in the beginning, so I stayed on .5mg for 8 weeks. I have been on 1mg the last 10 weeks per my doctor’s recommendation. I believe I will stay at 1mg for my next set of shots as well. 

We made a big move in the beginning of August across the US, so I have slowed my gym time way down as I was unpacking and getting into a new routine. During this transition, I was fortunate to not gain weight back, which was the normal for me when I was under stress. This drug has given me the opportunity to build a good relationship with food, I see it now as fuel and less like an emotional support. 

Now that life has settled and boxes are unpacked, I am getting back into the swing of a gym routine. I look forward to losing the last 10 pounds and working with my doctor on a taper down.

For the first time since 2020, I’m under 260lbs. I look a bit haggard — haven’t slept well the last two nights — but I’ll post the pic anyway. 🫩 (Swipe for my “before” pic)

The universe works in very strange ways.

Semaglutide has changed my life — and is helping me reclaim some of the life I thought I’d “lost”. I hope my story can be inspiring for anyone reading this on the fence about starting these meds… because I know that it was posts like this that finally inspired me to take the plunge.

1o8azja,Funfetti_Kate,5’2 175 lbs -> 130 lbs,"A few before and afters! 

1st photo: July 2024 -> October 2025
2nd photo: June 2024 -> June 2025
3rd photo: August 2024 -> August 2025

I started semaglutide in July 2024 at ~175 lbs as a 5’2” woman (5’2.5” on a good day!). Now I’m hovering around 130 lbs and weaning off semaglutide and wanted to share my experience. 

This has truly been a life-changing experience and I would do it again in a heartbeat. BUT I wasn’t one of those people who are lucky enough to not have side effects. I had fairly significant nausea, especially at the beginning. And fatigue was pretty limiting for a long time. But I was someone who would suffer immensely just to “be thin” (not a healthy mindset btw!! More on that later!). 

Semaglutide really stopped the food noise for me. I think I feel about food now the way most “normal” people do. I don’t fleetingly think about a specific junk food, then completely obsess over it until I have it. I don’t go to a restaurant and think I can have chicken tenders, fries, and ranch since it’s a special occasion because spoiler alert - I did that a lot (which kinda makes it not a special occasion!). I don’t throw my hands up in the air at a minor inconvenience and think, well now I HAVE to get fast food because I don’t have time to cook. And if I’m getting fast food I can treat myself to a large because this is a special occasion (because when you do this a lot, again it’s not a special occasion!). 

Now I do still do these things sometimes - but literally for special occasions! And then I get back to normal the next day, rather than spiraling on a food bender just because I got off track. If I know I’m going to an event and will be eating an indulgent meal, I try to eat light meals with lots of protein beforehand. In the past I would just think “well today will be a cheat day, so I’ll just eat whatever I want”. I do track my calories and weigh my food using a food scale, and I don’t see myself stopping that anytime soon. Being on the shorter side, I have less wiggle room with my calories in order to stay in a deficit. 

My advice - strength train!! I wish I had started sooner. I’m pretty sure a lot of my initial weight loss was fat AND muscle, so I started strength training consistently back in May of this year to try to eventually get that toned look. I also WFH 4 days a week and aim for a brisk walk on my walking pad for 1-2 hours on these days. If I don’t, I’m completely sedentary since I work a desk job.

The biggest change in me has been my mindset about fitness. I now see fitness as just part of my life… forever. I can’t use it to meet a goal, the stop because I’ll go back to square one. It’s about being able to move my body as I get older, have a healthy heart, and do the things I like to do with ease! And I would much rather maintain than start all over again. Food is the same - I’ve never been able to see it all so clearly.

1ohhiud,Avalvnche,Stalling after a year,"

Here are my ""stats"" - M29 Height-6'3"" Starting Weight- 400+ (never stepped on a scale once I saw 400) Goal Weight 199lbs Current Weight- 271lbs

A little context, I started tracking calories CICO, no added activity about a year ago, I was easily over 400lbs at the time, but like I said I never looked at the scale again once I saw 400. From Oct ish 2024 until about mid April/Early May I religiously tracked between 1200-1400 calories per day. Yes I know that wasn't the healthiest choice, but I felt extremely hungry until about that Early-Mid may timeframe so I stuck with it. 

I increased to about 1600 calories per day in May and started lifting again, low weight, high rep, no pre-workout. I had just crossed the 100lb mark (like 297lbs~ at that time) and I tried to stay at 1200-1400 while lifting but that was not happening. 

I ended up hurting my back after 4-5 weeks of lifting, but continued to track calories & saw more losses until recently. 

I started lifting again last month, this time with creatine, I've upped my calories to approximately 1800-2000/day. And I'm now gaining weight. I used to only weigh in once/month but I have been weighing in over the course of the month since I started working out 4 days/week with a creatine pre-workout. I'm not taking the recommended 5g/day, I take the Hyde pre workout 4 days/week before I workout. I'm up about 5lbs (low as of 10/01 was 266lbs) and today I stepped on & saw 271 and just felt like a complete failure. Aside from the occasional cheat meal which takes me close to or only slightly over my TDEE (with lifting & 10k steps daily, I assume I would be in the ~3400 cal per day TDEE from what I've seen in the calculators, even then I'm still not usually eating that much in a day) 

Am I overeating? Is it the creatine? Should I give it more time before making another change, possibly trying to lower back down to 1400/day?

Here are my ""stats"" - M29 Height-6'3"" Starting Weight- 400+ (never stepped on a scale once I saw 400) Goal Weight 199lbs Current Weight- 271lbs

A little context, I started tracking calories CICO, no added activity about a year ago, I was easily over 400lbs at the time, but like I said I never looked at the scale again once I saw 400. From Oct ish 2024 until about mid April/Early May I religiously tracked between 1200-1400 calories per day. Yes I know that wasn't the healthiest choice, but I felt extremely hungry until about that Early-Mid may timeframe so I stuck with it. 

I increased to about 1600 calories per day in May and started lifting again, low weight, high rep, no pre-workout. I had just crossed the 100lb mark (like 297lbs~ at that time) and I tried to stay at 1200-1400 while lifting but that was not happening. 

I ended up hurting my back after 4-5 weeks of lifting, but continued to track calories & saw more losses until recently. 

I started lifting again last month, this time with creatine, I've upped my calories to approximately 1800-2000/day. And I'm now gaining weight. I used to only weigh in once/month but I have been weighing in over the course of the month since I started working out 4 days/week with a creatine pre-workout. I'm not taking the recommended 5g/day, I take the Hyde pre workout 4 days/week before I workout.

1ohhnsg,Thaleios,How much should I expect to lose in a year?,"My doctor gave me a 30 day supply of wegovy because I'm a 50 yr old male with a BMI over 40.  I was not fat my entire life and in fact ran 5 miles a day through my mid 30s but a back injury sent me into a deep spiral as I couldn't move like I used to.

I lost 17 lbs this first month and the doctor seemed pleased with it but my insurance will not cover wegovy and my doctor will not prescribe ozempic off-label as I do not have diabetes.

So, if I spend the $500 per month, is it realistic to expect to lose a hundred pounds within a year?  I have to seriously consider if it is worth that money as I have a family I support and that is a freaking car payment or two.

Thanks for any words of wisdom.",1,1,2025-10-27T21:05:08,Semaglutide,https://www.reddit.com/r/Semaglutide/comments/1ohhnsg/how_much_should_i_expect_to_lose_in_a_year/,1.0,True,/r/Semaglutide/comments/1ohhnsg/how_much_should_i_expect_to_lose_in_a_year/,2025-10-27T21:06:30.926334,"How much should I expect to lose in a year?
