1kt92cg,Just_Wolverine_5622,"Semaglutide Weight Loss - 4 Months In, Here‚Äôs What I‚Äôve Learned","Hey everyone,

Just wanted to share my experience with semaglutide (Ozempic/Wegovy) after 4 months on it. I‚Äôve seen a lot of questions about what to expect, how it feels, and whether it‚Äôs ‚Äúworth it,‚Äù so here‚Äôs my honest rundown:

**Stats:**

* Starting weight: 238 lbs
* Current weight: 198 lbs
* Height: 5'7""
* Total loss: 40 lbs
* Time on sema: \~17 weeks (up to 1.7mg)

**What‚Äôs helped the most:**

* **Appetite reduction is REAL.** I used to constantly think about food. Now I have to remind myself to eat sometimes.
* **Portion control finally feels natural.** Half my old meal fills me up now.
* **No more binge cravings.** This was HUGE for me. It‚Äôs like my brain quieted down.
* **Weight loss is steady, not fast.** Around 2‚Äì3 lbs/week average. Some weeks were slower.

**Side effects I experienced:**

* Mild nausea the first couple of days after increasing dose
* Occasional fatigue
* Some constipation, but manageable with hydration + fiber

**Tips:**

* Eat slow, chew well ‚Äî you‚Äôll feel full faster
* Stay hydrated, especially during early weeks
* Don‚Äôt rely *only* on the med ‚Äî some light movement really helps
* Use the momentum to build better habits (meal prep, journaling, etc.)

I‚Äôve still got a way to go, but for the first time in YEARS I feel like I‚Äôm in control again.

Happy to answer any questions or hear how others are doing too ‚Äî it‚Äôs really motivating seeing everyone‚Äôs stories here. üí™",180,58,2025-05-23T08:18:58,Ozempic,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ozempic/comments/1kt92cg/semaglutide_weight_loss_4_months_in_heres_what/,0.98,True,/r/Ozempic/comments/1kt92cg/semaglutide_weight_loss_4_months_in_heres_what/

1o2c1dk,Foreign_Language_706,"One year on semaglutide, 77 lbs down, but the real change was my life ü´∂","I'm feeling so grateful and proud of myself in this moment, so I wanted to share my story in case it helps even one person who‚Äôs just starting, curious, or feeling unsure, because I was totally there, reading posts like this, wondering if I‚Äôd ever really change.

But I did it.

I officially hit one full year on my weight loss journey while on semaglutide, and I almost don‚Äôt recognize the person I was back then. When I started, I was around 310‚Äì320 lbs, and I was tired in ways I didn‚Äôt even fully understand. Even sitting sometimes felt like work!

Today I‚Äôm sitting at 233 lbs. That‚Äôs 77 lbs down!! But even better, I feel alive again.  
I actually have energy. I walk just because it feels good (and because I can). I take stairs without thinking. I can literally breathe easier. I even built a gym routine, and actually enjoy it. (Who even is she??)

For those wondering, semaglutide wasn‚Äôt a magic fix, but it gave me something I never had before: quiet.

The food noise that used to scream in my head for years finally turned down. My cravings became super manageable, sometimes even nonexistent. It‚Äôs like it gave me a pause button, just enough space to make better choices and build habits that stuck.

I knew losing weight sustainably was going to take time, which always felt daunting and why I would get involved in ‚Äúget skinny in 10 days‚Äù scams in the past. But I just had to try, and do it the healthiest way I could. Looking back, I had a lot more fun than I expected, and some days it almost felt too easy.

Weight loss really comes down to being in a calorie deficit. Once I figured out the range that worked for me, semaglutide saved my life, I was NEVER hungry. Hunger was always the true culprit behind reverting to old habits. This allowed me to just start. I wasn‚Äôt perfect, but I figured out how to eat my favorite foods while building a better mindset about portion control. That naturally led to being more mindful about the diet I wanted to maintain: high protein, good fiber, balanced plates.

This medication made my brain content with my choices, it didn‚Äôt demand pizza because of a bad day. And as we get older, it can feel tough seeing results, but my efforts always showed up. So wild.

I‚Äôll admit there were plateaus, especially around my monthly cycle, but my body would adjust and continue to release weight. There were some side effects, sulfur burps, some GI stuff early on, but honestly? My body handled it, and symptoms lessened over time. Even at its worst, I‚Äôd do it again a hundred times. What I got in return was a bigger, brighter world full of possibilities.

I fit comfortably on planes. I say yes to plans. I flirt again! I laugh more‚Ä¶ all the little things that make a huge difference in quality of life that I had sacrificed to my old habits. I feel like I‚Äôve been reintroduced to my own life.

I‚Äôm not done, probably another 70 lbs, but I‚Äôm so proud of what this year gave me.

If you‚Äôre at the beginning, keep going. The small promises you make to yourself add up in ways that will completely change your life. You‚Äôve got this. üíõ

156t7ew,trynabeaskinnybitch,The Real Secret Behind Semaglutide! 6lbs in first 2 weeks!,"My healthcare practitioner told me that there could be gastrointestinal side effects with semaglutiide injections. This is apparently the understatement of my most recent memory.  I was given a .25mg titration dose for the first 4 weeks, but was told that if week 1 I didn't notice any adverse affects I could go to .5mg at week 2. This was a cataclysmically bad idea. I am here to encourage you to stay the titration course. 

Week 1 on .25, I noticed an immediate reduction in appetite. Side effects were mild: a little dizzy, a little stomach pain, a little nausea but mostly from adjusting to having an emptier stomach or over eating at night. Heart burn in the morning is a real thing. If you push your night feeding, you're going to regret it the next morning. But only in the way where you feel a little hungover and sludgy when the alarm goes off the next morning. 

Week 2, I chugged up on .5mg. I got cocky. .25 was a breeze. In my rush to a hot girl fall body, I upped the dose. I injected on Sunday on an empty stomach, right after waking up. Everything was fine, but I started feeling 'woozy' that afternoon. By woozy, just a little dizzy/nauseous. 

Monday, I had zero appetite. I had half a cup of Chick fila chicken noodle soup. For dinner I had a protein shake. No milk. 

Tuesday morning, I woke up feeling like I swallowed a bowling ball. I showered with my face pressed against the cold tile wall. I made it to work and stared blankly at excel while feeling the reeling and tossing of the contents of my stomach. Thinking maybe a snack would help, I ate a slice of mango. 

The moment the mango entered my gullet, all hell breaks loose. I barely make it to the parking lot before I begin power puking. That is the only word for it. With the force of a category 5 hurricane, my guts reentered the world in a 3 feet spray over a 180 degree spray pattern. This is Texas at 11am. It is 107 degrees. Mango is flying out of my nose at Mach 4. It was a low point in my life. 

I continued this Olympic regurgitation until I had thrown up everything I had eaten since I was 25. Fairly certain I saw my wedding cake and that margarita from a few vacations back. While shooting calories across my commute back home, I got a mobile IV nurse in route to the house. She double dosed me with Zofran since I had stopped puking and had taken to dry heaving, my bodies attempt to prove it was sorry for every overeating and getting us fat in the first place. 

The vomiting stopped. Everything stopped. And by stopped, I mean the eye of the storm had settled over my bowels. Nary a gurgle commenced for four days. Do you know how weird it is to not fart for four days? I didn't mind it, but it was an odd phenomena. I found myself jiggling my gut around like, ""hello? Is anyone home?""

This miracle shot created horror at the thought of eating. I looked at a bowl of soup like Indiana Jones when he realized he was in the snake pit. Fear. Abject terror. Every swallow brought on the ""is this the bite that releases the cracken again?"" 

Then on Day 6 the dams of hell broke loose at the south end of the river. I have seen small children shit up their back. I had not experienced that as an adult. Until that day. In a public bathroom. 

And that is how I lost 6 lbs in first two weeks of the injections. Am I going to give up? No way. I'm just going to dial that injection back to .25mg and coast through next week without staring down a chicken breast like I'm negotiating with a terrorist. 

Here is to hoping week 3 has less geysers and lava flows. Good luck on your journey! May your ride be smoother than mine.

1ctgnwa,Ok_Confusion_6639,Why am I gaslighting myself re: taking a semaglutide!?,"My doctors keep talking to me about taking a semaglutide because I‚Äôm 275 as a 26 y/o female. I keep thinking, ‚Äúwell, I‚Äôve been chubby my whole life, I just should try harder to actually stick to a diet and then maybe the weight will come off.‚Äù I have PCOS so losing weight is so hard, but I am also ALWAYS hungry and always craving non-nutrient-dense foods. I keep thinking that other people need these drugs more, and that I‚Äôd only be taking it for cosmetic purposes. Meanwhile I‚Äôm developing NAFLD and my A1C is up a full point from last year (in the 4s to now 5.3, still good but have a family history of diabetes and I‚Äôm getting closer to pre-diabetes territory‚Ä¶ again). 

Any advice on the mindset here? 

EDIT: my biggest hesitancies are that I‚Äôm still breastfeeding, and want to lose weight to have more kids but then think ‚Äúwell, I‚Äôll probably just put it back on when I stop for pregnancy/breastfeeding again.‚Äù My doctor suggested this as a means to lose weight to be able to conceive another baby in due time without having as high of a blood pressure issue risk for another pregnancy like I did last time at 280+. So I‚Äôd have to be on it, then go off, then probably regain a lot of weight‚Ä¶ which to me feels like it wouldn‚Äôt be worth it if I‚Äôm just going to regain it without the med anyway.

1nyovp0,Adventurous-Map-3863,After 7 weeks of Semaglutide,"Hey y‚Äòall. I started Ozempic 7 weeks ago with 0.25mg, and today I took the 3rd dose of 0.50mg. 
Thought I wanted to share a few things that I have  noticed: 
For reference, F37, 5.5ft, starting weight 176lbs, current: 164 lbs
I started working out and changed my diet 3 years ago, after my mom had a stroke. Started working out 4-5 a week, and focusing on high protein diet. Fast forward 2 years later I had actually gained 15 lbs instead of loosing it, and the advice of ‚Äúoh it‚Äôs probably muscle mass‚Äù just was not cutting it for me. I had bloodwork done twice, but everything seemed to be fine, I suspected PCOS, but my medical provider (we are military, Tricare, so it seems like they really just do what‚Äôs medically necessary) didn‚Äôt see a big problem with it, and I would get a referral. I researched a lot myself, and realized I forgot I have a IUD (mirena) for birth control. After researching, I realized that the IUD might be responsible for my slow and steady weight gain. I am scheduled to have my IUD removed and my tubes tied, but I just didn‚Äôt want to wait any longer. I went online and got semaglutide prescribed, and I actually really love it. 7 weeks in, I have lost 12 lbs so far.
My highlights so far: 
- food cravings are gone, I actually struggle to get enough protein in
- I stopped smoking, I planned stopping long time ago, but I‚Äôm disgusted by even the thought of it
- I have no more desire in going out to restaurants, which helps my wallet as well 
- I don‚Äôt buy random shit in the grocery store, I am sticking to my list
- I stick to my meal prep. Ordering lunch at work seems like ‚Äúnot worth it‚Äù anymore 
- last thing I realized today: I seem to have no desire to go shopping. I might have had a slight shopping addiction, but the random ‚Äúlet‚Äôs go to Target or the mall to just look‚Äù have completely stopped. Again, good for my wallet. 
- besides headaches in the first couple weeks of taking it, and a little nausea when drinking coffee, no side effects 

Other things I noticed: 
- I lost a bit of drive going to the gym 
- I feel I‚Äôm quicker exhausted at the gym
- I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever lost that much weight that quick, so I‚Äôm afraid my skin starts sagging 
- I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôm loosing muscle mass. Thinking about adding in creatine, but when I tried creatine in the past, I gained 10-15 lbs immediately. So im afraid to try it again. 
- the first 4-5 weeks I couldn‚Äôt drink coffee, but it seems to be fine the last 2 weeks

1eqkxbz,RangerOk2016,I'm only 26 with no health issues other than being obese. Is it ethical/ok to be on semaglutide/ozempic for life? It's the only thing that works. ,"I only started a month ago but it's been the only thing that's worked to cure the food noise. There are some side effects but they're pretty tolerable otherwise. I'm mostly just scared at the idea of coming up. Even when calorie counting, exercise, keto, etc other bull shit diets this is the only thing that's worked.

My only issue is I get my prescription from WeightRx, an online med prescriber. It seems like after a year or when you hit their goal weight they take you off, which I understand. That being said, I will gladly take this med for the rest of my life and feel like I'll need to. How would I go about that? Should I talk to my primary care doc now and let them know? Should I wait until after? Would a doc even prescribe me them if I'm at a healthy weight and I say I need them for maintenance? 

I'm just hoping someone has experience with using a telehealth option for a long period of time. Or maybe they'll let me do it for life, I'm not sure.

There wasn‚Äôt any inflammation but there are gallstones so I‚Äôm going to speak to a surgeon to see what I need to do. But my question is has this happen to anyone else?

Cutted sugar, bought vegetable, eating protein. Not doing exercise though, I have trigeminal neuralgia, is summer, the sun light hurts my face, but I have been lifting weights at home (Could do better) but I am 90 percent sure my calorie intake is reduced drastically

The third and fourth day with 0.5 I could never finish my plate (not feeling nauseous but just couldn't finish, so I have been trained to put less and less food. I have made soup to be able to eat. I am eating fruits, vegetable, carbs for sure from vegetable, protein like mostly chicken breast.

Feeling worse stomach pain. I already suffer with bad reflux, always have water and pepto bismol to relieve the constant heartburn. After this compound semaglutide have been a little worse. I started taking Omeprazole. 

Maybe I should wait for raising the dose, next week will be 1,5. But this is my third week and it was 280lbs the 280,1, now 280,5... The food noise is coming back and I am disappointed. Hope the medicine is not fake and I have to track what is so caloric in my diet that is ruining it.

112epc6,MysteriousResult2876,Compounded Semaglutide. Discuss‚Ä¶?,"I‚Äôve recently discovered that Med Spas, Plastic Surgeons, etc are starting to offer in-office weekly Semaglutide weight loss programs. Im in Southern California so there are a lot of them here. The place I spoke to will charge $75 per injection up to 2 mg. They specifically advertised that it is not Ozempic and does not impact the supply shortage affecting diabetics. It comes in a vial and they inject you with a needle like botox or a vaccine. The drug is not from Novo Nordisk; it is made by a compounding pharmacy. and this doctor told me to get around the patent/legality, the pharmacy compounds it with vitamin B12, therefore making it a different drug. But with the same effect. I am skeptical.  I found some articles online warning doctors against prescribing these compounded drugs because it‚Äôs unclear where the semaglutide even comes from and if it‚Äôs a different form of a semaglutide ‚Äúsalt‚Äù which could have different therapeutic levels.

I think this is interesting particularly the legality of it and the fact that it apparently doesn‚Äôt impact the shortages of the ‚Äúpens.‚Äù I‚Äôm curious to hear if you guys have heard of this or have experience with it. Perhaps this method is appropriate for the medspa patient who is not majorly overweight, where the risk of potency and accuracy isn‚Äôt as serious as it could be to a diabetic or somebody treating morbid obesity. 

I‚Äôve been getting my Ozempic pens from a Canadian pharmacy and it‚Äôs costing $380 now so this would be more cost effective for me. I‚Äôm not sure I want to take the plunge lol.

1m2ins3,Otherwise-Egg-1511,"I did a 6+ month micro-taper off semaglutide (from 1 mg/week to 0) using the ""click method"" ‚Äì no weight regain. Has anyone else tried this?","I wanted to share a tapering method I used to come off semaglutide (Ozempic) very slowly and with full weight maintenance ‚Äì no bounce-back, no hunger surge. I haven‚Äôt seen this level of precision discussed yet, so maybe it helps someone.


---

Baseline:

Weekly dose: 1 mg/week, split into two 0.5 mg injections per week.

I used the pen‚Äôs click increments to taper down extremely slowly.



---

Tapering method:

I started with 2√ó38 clicks/week (‚âà1 mg total).

Then I reduced total weekly dose by 2 clicks per month, meaning:

2√ó36 clicks/week for 1 month,

then 2√ó34/week for 1 month,

and so on...


I went all the way down to 2√ó26 clicks/week (~0.68 mg total), then stopped completely.

So the taper lasted ~6 months, total dose drop of ~32%.



---

My context:

I'm male, mid-30s, 180 cm (5'11""), started at 134 kg, reached 89 kg over time.

Daily steps: 12k+, training: 3√ó strength + 2√ó sprinting per week.

Diet: Clean, high-protein (~180 g/day), mostly low-carb/keto.

No major cravings, stable blood sugar, regular tracking.



---

Result:

Zero weight regain after stopping.

Hunger didn‚Äôt spike, I didn‚Äôt ""feel the drop"" because it was so slow.

I think the body adapted naturally while lifestyle took over.

I never saw this discussed in literature or Reddit ‚Äì anyone else try a ""click taper""?



---

Why I‚Äôm posting: Most people stop cold turkey or reduce by mg steps (1.0 ‚Üí 0.5 ‚Üí 0.25). I believe microtapering via clicks might prevent the typical rebound. If you‚Äôve tried something similar ‚Äì or want to ‚Äì let‚Äôs compare notes.

There are enough Semaglutide success stories that I'm not totally heartbroken. However, it is kind of disheartening that people who have a medication that is working have to change to a different compound for what amounts to a business decision. But I figured I'd check and see what the common experience was- did you keep your appetite under control at the same pace? Did the effects drop off? Any new side effects? Any small ones go away? 

I also have sleep apnea, which Zepbound is approved for while Wegovy is not. I also sought out a GLP-1 agonist because I'm getting sober (58 days!!), and Zepbound has helped tremendously with the cravings. While Semaglutide also is known to have these effects, it's kind of scary to switch a drug when the stakes are this high (sobriety is literally life or death for me). So if anyone saw an increase or decrease in alcohol noise I'd love to hear about that too. 

So anyways, how's it going for you glp fam? ",4,17,2025-05-29T07:56:39,Ozempic,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ozempic/comments/1kxzlej/anyone_switch_from_tirzepatide_to_semaglutide/,0.67,True,/r/Ozempic/comments/1kxzlej/anyone_switch_from_tirzepatide_to_semaglutide/

I immediately had hunger suppression and started shedding pounds because I simply wasn‚Äôt eating much. By December 2024 I had lost 40 pounds. My fatty liver had gone away, A1C went down and periods got more regular. Then in January my dad died and I skipped filling my prescription because of everything going on. February I found out I had a T-rads 4 thyroid nodule. So, I stopped the injections and gained about 30 of the 40 lost pounds back. I talked to a doctor and decided to monitor the nodule because it is small and was cleared to continue my weight loss injections because my hypertension and other problems are more of a threat to my health than the thyroid nodule (found incidentally, no symptoms, bloodwork normal) for now. So I started back on the small dose last month. I‚Äôm now on 0.5mg and when I tell you I feel nothing, I mean NOTHING like I did the first time.

My sister gave me a vial of semaglutide for christmas. I had just lost 12 lbs on my own with intermittent fasting. My weight usually fluxuates from 220 lbs, but since i quit my adderall, it shot all the way up to 260 lbs. I was struggling but had managed to get down to 240 lbs with intermittent fasting (I would wake up and as long as i didn't eat until 4pm it was relatively easy to lose weight steadily) My sister thought I was still pudgy at 260 lbs and bought me semaglutide for xmas. I didn't want to be one of those people who resorts to ""jabs"" just to lose weight. I'm pretty skeptical of the pharma industry in general, and had just quit adderall after being on it for 20 years! Which was real real hard. Even though I was skeptical i decided to plow ahead. I took my first shot on christmas... I went up to 15 units by the third shot. Just weighed myself and I am 220 lbs, and feel slimmer but still have a ways to go. A couple things i hate about it is i'm pretty constipated, to the point where i can taste it in my mouth! yucky... and when i try to go to the bathroom only a tiny bit comes out. The longer i would go constipated, I would notice indigestion and burps getting acidic and making me wanna vomit.

I had no side effects at all and had a pretty stable weight loss. I really believe this is a miracle drug helping not just my physical health but also mental health. around april I started to use creatine and resistance training to prevent muscle loss as much as possible. From that point my weight loss stalled. Unfortunately up to now I only record my body weight so no real way for me to measure my body composition (from now on I will also take tape measures) and I know creatine can make you gain water weight. But seeing a plateau on the graph still makes me question myself. I wonder if it is the increased water weight from the creatine/ gaining muscle while loosing fat creates this plateau or the drug simply stopped working for me, where I live I can not increase my dose either. Does anybody had a similar experince? Like a temporary stall with incorporating resistance training / using creatine.

Pharmaceutical corporations-insurance companies work hand in hand.

Drug causes weight loss and can swing people from morbid situations into healthy(healthier) ones... Where previously they may have been dependant on meds for other weight related health issues, but now can reduce and sometime come off of other pricey meds...  Seems like a great tool for improving society-physically, mentally, financially.. and reduces the burden on the health care system...

So what's the issue?  I'm thinking Corporate greed and capitalism.Improving health of a society = decreased spending by society on medication = less revenue for pharmaceutical corporations...

1lvken7,Nova_Sage_,Semaglutide for endometriosis,"Let me start by saying I‚Äôm a nurse for ten years (ER & ICU). My weight easily fluctuates, where I‚Äôve been able to lose and gain relatively quickly. I am 5‚Äô4 at 174. Admittedly, I carry my weight well, to where even my PCP wasn‚Äôt surprised at my BMI and not concerned. I do, however, have endometriosis not necessarily confirmed with surgery (which PSA: is the only way to truly diagnose it) but I have a good rapport with my OB and symptoms plus family history (two of my sister required surgery and had stage 3&4), we felt comfortable calling a spade a spade. 

I‚Äôve been hesitant to have the surgery just because it‚Äôs only a temporary fix and the longer you can put off surgery the more you can space out subsequent surgeries and decrease risk of adhesions. But since having my daughter (she‚Äôs 3) and stopping breast feeding (20months), my symptoms were awful. I have high pain tolerance (I passed a kidney stone at work then kept working) but the hip and pelvic pain was God awful and not just during my period. In addition to that, I felt constantly inflamed. My hands and feet were constantly swelling with no discernible reason. Labs were perfect other than low vit D (hello, inflammation/IBS). It was becoming more and more clear this was endometriosis which is an inflammatory disease.

Ozempic gets a bad rep, but I think a huge part of it is patients starting on too high of a dose and then moving up too quick. I ended up down the Ozempic rabbit hole when I read a case study in early stages using low dose (micro dose) semaglutide to treat endometriosis. Most of the current studies are in the early stages, but the anecdotal findings from patients and physicians alike has been really compelling. This led me down other rabbit holes of the true breakthrough that this drug is treating everything from chronic diseases to heroine addiction. As a nerd, this was an exciting. 

One thing I knew to be irrefutable is the fact that it is already known weight loss will decrease symptoms of endo (as well as PCOS) as fat cells produce estrogen (more fat cells = more estrogen). I‚Äôm on hormonal therapy for endo (progestin) which was taking the edge off but not remotely providing relief. So finally I said fuck it, ordered compounded semaglutide. My plan was only to microdose at 0.125mg indefinitely or until there are no more benefits. I‚Äôm almost finished with my second week and so far it‚Äôs been eye opening.

For starters, everything you‚Äôve read about eating too much (or how much you ate before the shot) making you feel sick is true. Even at such a low dose, I‚Äôd experience nausea and stomach cramps if I ate large portions. When I eat smaller portions, not so bad. My GERD is slightly worse, but it was awful before so I hardly blame the shot for that. Since I‚Äôm not taking it for weight loss per se, I haven‚Äôt been tracking my weight but I‚Äôm nearly certain I‚Äôve lost a good amount. My scrubs waist band was feeling snuck before and is now comfortable and loose now. I‚Äôm eating normal sized portions of food which is telling because I didn‚Äôt realize how much larger my portions were until this. I still have cravings every now and then, but nothing intense. I still experience hunger, etc I just require less food to feel satiated. 

Wildly enough, I‚Äôve found myself craving fresher foods, eating more fruits and vegetables than I did before. Sometimes I‚Äôd notice I wasn‚Äôt feeling great and then I‚Äôd eat an apple and then nausea gone. Which was just so fascinating to me because I‚Äôve never just been like ‚ÄúI could eat an apple or banana right now‚Äù. Like ever. As far as GI symptoms, I‚Äôve had IBS all my life and that‚Äôs about the same. I treat the reflux with Pepcid (antacid) and Omeprazole (proton pump inhibitor) for longer relief and healing of my esophagus. Nausea was not new for me either, as I get this around my cycle with endometriosis but now I can get relief by eating a healthy snack. Again, this is just so fascinating to me. 

As far as my endometriosis, my pelvic pain has significantly decreased. The swelling in my hands and feet are gone. I feel less fatigue and moody. I still have the hip pain, but it‚Äôs more tolerable. For being only one and half weeks in, I found this pretty substantial but will  be curious to see how my next cycle goes. I started the injection right after my cycle to give my body time to adjust before the dreaded period. 

But to overview, microdosing seems effective for endo as well as weight loss. I‚Äôm eating better than before out of genuine almost as if the medicine makes me want healthier foods. Greasy unhealthy foods definitely don‚Äôt sit well with my stomach. Reflux is worse but it was already bad, so treating with meds and small snacks (GERD is worse on an empty stomach). Weight loss has been notable, but more likely due to retained fluid for it be this drastic so early, which is still an added bonus. Decreased hand and feet swelling has been a huge plus (I didn‚Äôt realize how much that was bothering me). IBS is the same‚Äîthis medicine has not wrecked my stomach. If anyone is on the fence, I think it‚Äôs worth a try. Buying it compounded is definitely the cheapest, but I understand why most people wouldn‚Äôt feel comfortable doing that. 

As far as medicines, I‚Äôm taking Pepcid/famotidine 20mg twice a day, omeprazole 20mg daily, post-natal vitamins (left over from postpartum) and vit D 50,000u once a week (I take it with the shot bc it‚Äôs easier). I‚Äôm still on my prescription Adderall and Zoloft and no problems there. Will continue progestin (progesterone only BC for endo) and will update as my cycle progresses for anyone with endo.

I started Semaglutide back in February and have only lost about 6-7 pounds since then. I'm not on the max dose yet but I will be soon. I'm feeling a little disappointed and impatient and thinking about switching to Tirzepitide. Would you give Semaglutide longer to see if it kicks in (especially since I haven't hit the max dose yet) or switch to a different med?

I‚Äôve been on semaglutide for a little over 4 months now (currently at 1.7mg) and have lost around 40 lbs total. Appetite suppression has been solid, cravings are way more manageable, and I‚Äôve built a better routine overall. So, in many ways, it‚Äôs working.

But lately, I feel like I‚Äôve plateaued a bit ‚Äî weight loss has slowed down, and side effects (especially fatigue and constipation) have been creeping back in. I‚Äôve been hearing more and more about tirzepatide and how some people see even better results with fewer side effects.

**For anyone who switched from semaglutide to tirzepatide:**

* What made you decide to switch?
* How was the transition?
* Did you notice a big difference in hunger control, side effects, or energy?
* Anything you wish you knew before switching?

Medication is not a replacement for therapy or working through your issues -- I am doing that too! But for me it helped calm the food noise and cravings and obsessive thinking, and helps regulate my blood sugar. It bought me the space to make better choices and set better habits.

1jt3bmc,FangShway,I wasnt getting desired results until I started pairing semaglutide with Naltrexone.,"I had been taking 2mg of semaglutide per week and was having very inconsistent results. Most of the time it has a very minor effects that would wear off on day 3-4. Some weeks it would work great and sometimes it felt like I didn't take it at all. 

I tried spreading my dose out but dipping down from 2mg to 1mg twice a week when I sometimes barely felt the effects of 2mg wasn't much of a solution either.

Thankfully I have little to no side effects other than the burps occasionally but I was getting very little *intended* effects as well. I still very much had ""food noise"" all of the time and craved sweets more than I ever had before taking a GLP-1.

I had taken it for 12 months, I lost 40lbs in the first 3 months and 5-10 more over the remaining 9 months. (290 - ~245). I wasnt putting in any extra effort to lose weight at the time. I didn't try any special diet and I wasnt getting regular excersize. I just new all my portions were much smaller.

I was off it for 5 months and was able to maintain my weight between 245 and 250 as I started excersizing regularly playing pickleball. While I was off of it, I had been prescribed Naltrexone which had a very minor effect of curbing cravings. Not enough to really help lose weight but enough to help maintain it. 

I got back on semaglutide last month and taking it in concert with Naltrexone has been a night and day difference. I finally understand what it feels like to not have food noise or feel like I want to eat even if I'm not hungry.

I am confident that it is the interaction with Naltrexone as I had a mixup with my prescription and was not able to take it for a week, and during that time, the semaglutide started feeling weaker as it had previously. And once I got back on the Naltrexone the following week, the desired effects returned.

Just wanted to share my story in case anyone else out there is like me and feels resistant to the effects of semaglutide, even at a high dose of 2mg.",10,7,2025-04-07T01:43:33,Ozempic,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ozempic/comments/1jt3bmc/i_wasnt_getting_desired_results_until_i_started/,0.92,True,/r/Ozempic/comments/1jt3bmc/i_wasnt_getting_desired_results_until_i_started/

1l4zpo9,ThrowRA_princess4,"I always knew something was wrong, but being on Ozempic for 2 years finally confirmed it.","A little back story: 


I‚Äôve struggled with food for as long as I can remember. I used to have intense cravings and would gorge myself at birthday parties/holidays with junk food and dessert. When I got older, the cravings became unbearable. I also grew up in an emotionally abusive household developed a binge-eating disorder as a coping mechanism. I used to play sports in high school, so I was able to manage my weight for the most part. As I got older and experienced more trauma, the binge eating got worse. Graduating and stopping sports caused me to gain weight quite rapidly. No matter what I did, I could not stop the hunger and I did not have the ability to feel full. Exercise was AWFUL because any sort of exercise, despite me eating beforehand, made me RAVENOUSLY hungry to the point where I would be in tears trying to do squats in my living room. I kept telling my psychiatrist, therapist, doctor that I could not get rid of this hunger no matter what , and I kept getting told it was all in my head. 



Well, jokes on everyone because I‚Äôve been on .25mg for 2 years and I can now eat like a normal fucking person. I‚Äôm 5ft tall and started at 155lbs. Im now between 115-120 and I‚Äôve been maintaining this for over a year. It‚Äôs also crazy to me that I can now exercise without extreme hunger and tears. My life is no longer controlled by food and I cannot express how liberating it feels to eat because I want to, not because my body is screaming at me that it HAS to. 



And in my opinion, the reason I haven‚Äôt had to increase my dose is because *something* has been wrong the whole time. I‚Äôm not a medical professional, but I truly believe my body was lacking the ability to produce GLP-1 correctly. I only experienced side-effects during the first week and have had 0 since. I was genuinely in awe for the first few months because I was like ‚Äúis this how normal people experience day-to-day hunger???‚Äù. Going from 24/7 cravings and constant food noise to *nothing* was a crazy experience. 



I know there is tons of stigma around using this medication for weight loss, but I‚Äôm telling you that Ozempic saved my life. 


*EDIT TO ADD BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE CANNOT READ* 

Ya‚Äôll I am 5 feet tall. I used to work at a daycare with 10 year olds bigger than me. My mom is 4‚Äô11‚Äù. I come from a line of short people.

1kyiumn,Jk-1996,Coming off Ozempic - 7 Month Update,"I started Ozempic back in November 2023 and stopped taking it at the end of September 2024. I have been off Ozempic, maintaining my weight since I stopped. It has certainly been a journey, and my weight will likely be a battle my whole life.  I wanted to share my maintenance journey with you all.







# Common Questions



How much weight did you lose?



*I started at 293 lbs in September 2023, and today I weigh 181 lbs. (down 112 lbs)*



How have you been maintaining the weight loss?



*I am more active than ever, and I work out/exercise every day. I play a lot of team sports and am part of a running club. I have been keeping a strict diet, with a weekly cheat day. I eat a lot cleaner and less greasy fast foods / take out.*



Did the food noise come back?



*OOOH Yeah! The hunger definitely comes back, but you just need to be consistent and strict with your diet. I do believe the diet is a huge part of maintaining the weight loss. I do a weekly meal prep for my work lunches, and I eat snacks and meals that are overall healthier. I have cut out all unnecessary sugars in my beverages.*



  

Would you recommend Ozempic?



*Yes, I would recommend it to others. Ozempic really helped me to shed the weight. It was great to see the quick results. It can be discouraging when you feel like you‚Äôre doing everything right but you don‚Äôt see the scale reflecting that. If you need a kick start, and Ozempic works for you, I recommend it.*



  

Plans for the future?



*I carry a lot of hanging skin since the weight loss, so I plan to continue working out and doing strength training to fill the loose skin with muscles. I also plan on continuing my healthier lifestyle with my diet and daily exercise.*",957,121,2025-05-30T00:21:16,Ozempic,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kyiumn,0.99,False,/r/Ozempic/comments/1kyiumn/coming_off_ozempic_7_month_update/

1l96shy,Alive_Instance4069,Why do people say Ozempic is cheating? Cheating what?,"I don‚Äôt get how people can say taking Ozempic is cheating. Like, cheating what? Health isn‚Äôt a game. Weight loss isn‚Äôt a game. What exactly am I cheating?

You take Tylenol for a headache. Is that cheating? You take antibiotics when you‚Äôre sick. Is that cheating? So how is using something that helps your body regulate insulin and control appetite somehow crossing the line?

People act like Ozempic is magic. It‚Äôs not. You still have to change how you eat. You still have to deal with side effects. You still have to show up and do the work. And guess what..most of us already tried doing it the hard way for years.

When people say it‚Äôs cheating, what they really mean is:
‚ÄúYou lost weight faster than me.‚Äù
‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt suffer the way I did.‚Äù
‚ÄúI had to starve and you didn‚Äôt.‚Äù
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not fair that you made it look easy.‚Äù

I feel like it‚Äôs Insecurity. Jealousy. Projection. 

It‚Äôs not cheating to use the tools that actually work for your body. You‚Äôre not a better person because you struggled longer. You don‚Äôt win a trophy for white-knuckling it. Some of us were just done fighting our own biology.

Let people stay mad.

I just wanted to share my success and open up dialogue for others to share to celebrate their victories as well because I LOVE seeing it!! I love how accepting and wonderful you all are in this community, so thank you, truly!!!

Honestly, I‚Äôm just so blessed and so thankful that Ozempic quite literally saved my life. Ozempic is not a cure-all, it still takes the hard work and the dedication to wanting to improve your quality of life.

1fus91c,Wintaru,"13 months on Ozempic, soon to be done","For my birthday I was diagnosed with diabetes last year. The before photo was right around that time, but not my heaviest ever (that is the last comparison photo). We tried metformin etc at first but I couldn‚Äôt tolerate it so I got the OK from insurance to try Ozempic.

Had hip surgery in November last year (torn labrum and they released my IT band), which is my 6th surgery in the past 10 years, all my joints are shot from being overweight. In March I started lifting weights 4x a week and in May I started biking 40 miles a week. Was astonished to find I could bike daily and not be super sore from the bike seat üòÖ

Told my doc I‚Äôd like to try going off it next year. Deductible will reset and I can‚Äôt eat enough protein to do much good with the weight lifting. I count calories religiously (I weigh everything) and I‚Äôm at about 1300 per day, on a good day. Some days I don‚Äôt make it past 1100 calories even with all my activity. 

I plateaued for 4 months from February through May, then lost another 25lbs over the summer. Super close to my goal, which was 160 but I‚Äôm kinda hoping to get into the 150‚Äôs before I go off it and start focusing on building muscle. We will see. I am 46 years old and 5‚Äô10‚Äù so I don‚Äôt think 150‚Äôs is out of the question. I went from size 48 waist and I just bought jeans last week that are size 30. Might squeeze into 28‚Äôs before this is all over lol.

If anyone is on the fence about trying it I would say go for it honestly. I‚Äôm super disappointed in myself that I let things get that bad. Lots of loose skin and I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever build enough muscle to fill it out again at my age. Pissed off that I threw my late 20‚Äôs and all of my 30‚Äôs away like that.

Terrible denial after denial on the Prior Auths.  Always denied for the same reason - Patient doesn't have DM.  Well... I accident bumbled my way around that... 


See the lab test, A1C, is the standard way to diagnosis DM. A1C >6.5 = DM. I had a patient who consistently got 6.4 on her A1C... 3 times in a row. I suggested she do a GTT as it is more sensitive. Bam: Now she is diabetic. 

Then it hit me.  With Glucose tolerance testing (GTT) you drink 100g of sugar and go back 2 hours later to see if your BG is elevated.  If it is... bam DM.  See where this is going?? No one truly monitors what you eat during the two hours... they just ""ask"" that you fast.  I explain this protocol to patients all the time.  Wink wink, gosh I hope you aren't diabetic.

12usv0d,Choco_donut2222,I‚Äôve been off of ozempic for past 5 months‚Ä¶ this is what happened,"12/2023 update: it‚Äôs been almost a year since I stopped ozempic. The lowest I weighed was 140 and right now I‚Äôm 145. It‚Äôs been going up and down but it‚Äôs always around 145ish. So after one year of stopping ozempic, I gained 5 pounds. I‚Äôll take it. 


Ok, so ever since I had my two children, I gained 50 pounds and I just couldn‚Äôt get rid of the weight no matter what I did. I guess my hormones and metabolism got all messed up after having kids, so I decided to try ozempic from last April to November. Thankfully I lost 50 pounds so I‚Äôm back to my pre-kids weight so I‚Äôm very pleased. I really wanted to stop using ozempic since I had no desire to lose more weight, but at the same time, I was hesitant to stop using it due to everyone saying you gain back everything. Coincidentally my insurance changed and they stopped covering it so I naturally just stopped the medication after my last dose at the end of November. Since the medication stays in your body for 4-6 weeks, I didn‚Äôt gain any weight back from December to January. Then when February hit, I could tell that my appetite was through the roof and I started eating. But that happened for like the first two weeks and then I had to start controlling myself so I was extra conscious of what I was eating, when I was eating, etc (also mdoing exercises). Overall, I‚Äôve gained 4 pounds and I‚Äôm maintaining it. I could definitely see why you gain back everything once off of the medicine due to your appetite going back to normal or even higher. However if you‚Äôre conscious of your diet and do exercises, you won‚Äôt gain all the weight back!! all the studies and media make it sound like you bounce back up or higher after stopping ozempic , but ultimately you can control it!!!

Edit: ok, the reason I posted this is for those who don‚Äôt want to be on ozempic forever. I simply used ozempic as a tool to get my weight loss started and since it did its job, it‚Äôs my job to maintain it. I stumbled a few times because my appetite was so high after stopping it, but it went back down and Ive been stable with my weight (after gaining 4 pounds)  by doing HIT and peloton but most importantly eating the right food at the right time. I‚Äôm a pharmacist so I‚Äôm not someone who doesn‚Äôt know how to read the clinical studies. Those of you who are negative and say that all the weight will come back, maybe it‚Äôll come back for you but at the rate of what I‚Äôm doing to maintain, I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs the case. Good luck to all.

Whatever the reason, obesity is an easy boogeyman and ‚Äòit‚Äôs cure‚Äô is the simplest right? ‚ÄòEat less, move more‚Äô, no fucking clue about the inner workings of the disease. IT AFFECTS US TO THE FUCKING CELLULAR LEVEL.

If ozempic is a novelty drug that should be restricted then why are people who have never been able to lose weight successfully suddenly doing it now? Covid changed their life? They got old? Maybe.

But it‚Äôs fucking Semaglutide, the drug that finally addresses obesity in a multi prong attack that doesn‚Äôt wreck your CNS/CVS and only is risky when not titrated properly and if you‚Äôre the unlucky ones with a specific form of thyroid cancer.

Besides that, you‚Äôre good. Make lifestyle changes with the help of mental health professionals and the weight will work out much better for you in the long run either way regardless of ozempic. The studies have proven that the people who get off Semaglutide do not put back their baseline amount of weight, and when you spend half your fucking life being 300 odd lbs that‚Äôs a big fucking deal.

Sorry, this is a lot of anger but people just don‚Äôt get it. This isn‚Äôt a fucking moral failure, it‚Äôs a fucking disease. I mean why don‚Äôt you just control your blood pressure by reducing stress and calming down? Should work right? Heart problems? Chilllax boi, bring that heart rate down.

Fucking stupid. Stupid. Thanks to the assholes who had to use it to lose the 15 lbs they couldn‚Äôt get off for their shitty middle aged suburbia cocktail parties to fit in their shit suits/dresses. Guess what; it‚Äôs not a choice we made, there are physiological and psychological forces at play here that we barely even understand yet.

In the future, this will be laughed at as usual, just like treating substance use disorder like a crime. Fucking, stupid.

TLDR: Fuck you. Ozempic is saving lives and making a huge amount of people finally beat a disease that is growing rapidly and has devastating consequences in the long run. 200 odd lbs lost yet still stuck with 200 odd lbs of bullshit. Fuck off. Unless you‚Äôve carried the weight, lived with it, and lost it, shut the fuck up.

1mq8deb,beanschca,11 Months Ozempic Progress,"I just celebrated my 35th birthday, and it felt extra magical. Because not only do I love the way I look again. But because of all the strides and progress I‚Äôve made with my physical health. 2 years ago, my POTS would only allow me to do recumbent cycling for 8 minutes. I started with 8 tiny minutes of exercise when I started the CHOP Dysautonomia exercise program. I worked my way up to 30 minutes over a year. And for my birthday my husband got me an e-bike and now I can ride for 45 minutes upright with him. 

I fought so hard for my physical health. And then when I found ozempic it helped me even more with my inflammation, with my insulin resistance. And that cascaded into fixing so many other issues I had.

My health isn‚Äôt perfect. I still have challenges. But I am a different person than I was 2-3 years ago. I‚Äôm so grateful for how hard I fought to get here ‚ù§Ô∏è

Some days I think I still look like the woman on the left. It‚Äôs hard to recognize I‚Äôm that person on the right. But I know that version of me would be so proud of where I am today.

They pulled me over for inspection and told me Ozempic is considered a controlled substance and technically can‚Äôt be brought over. But they still let me keep it and just said ‚Äúno more next time.‚Äù

From what I know, Ozempic (semaglutide) isn‚Äôt a controlled substance in the U.S. so I was a little confused.

Has anyone else run into this when bringing it back from Mexico? I‚Äôm wondering if maybe it‚Äôs just how individual agents interpret the rules.

1i8ngc5,quinfchris77,Oprah Winfrey says taking Ozempic made her come to realisation about ‚Äòthin people‚Äô,"‚ÄòI thought thin people had more willpower,‚Äô the media mogul said

Oprah Winfrey has said taking weight-loss medication changed her preconceptions about ‚Äúthin people‚Äù.
The billionaire, 69, who confirmed she uses an unnamed drug as a tool to manage her weight after heavy speculation in 2023, admitted she previously thought slighter people had ‚Äúmore willpower‚Äù. 
Winfrey ‚Äì formerly a member of the WeightWatchers board ‚Äì has praised the medication for allowing her to live a healthier lifestyle, after career-spanning scrutiny over her figure.
The media mogul, who previously slammed weight loss drugs as the ‚Äúeasy way out‚Äù, said on her Super Soul podcast: ‚ÄúOne of the things that I realized the very first time I took a GLP-1 was that all these years I thought that thin people had more willpower.

However, Winfrey claimed that what she initially thought was ‚Äúwillpower‚Äù was actually a lack of intrusive hunger thoughts, also known as ‚Äúfood noise‚Äù.
Experts have claimed GLP-1 medications, such as Ozempic, Wegovy, may help lessen or even stop ‚Äúfood noise‚Äù by slowing down digestion and reducing cravings.

‚ÄúThe fact that there‚Äôs a medically approved prescription for managing weight and staying healthier, in my lifetime, feels like relief, like redemption, like a gift, and not something to hide behind and once again be ridiculed for. I‚Äôm absolutely done with the shaming from other people and particularly myself,‚Äù she said.

It‚Äôs the only semaglutide we have in my country, and I‚Äôm trying to set realistic expectations for myself. I‚Äôve lost about 7 kg (15 lbs) in 2.5 months, but I‚Äôm wondering if I can actually reach my goal weight just on this med. (of course with excersice and a balanced diet)

1iesrvf,SituationMindless561,Ozempic is turning me into a super human,"Hello Everyone. I am a 40 year old female that had three babies back to back and packed tonns of weight. I used to be so into fitness before having my babies, and after becoming a mom my life turned into a shitstorm. Crying colicky babies, autism diagnosis for two of them, sleepless nights. Anyway, I hit 250lbs and I am only 5'3. I ordered Ozempic from a foreign country ( my husband had a business trip and grabbed me four pens at a cost of $150 each) and I started injecting myself. This is my second week. I inject every saturday. Anyway, after starting ozempic I wasn't having any side effects or any effects and was worried that it wasn't working. I felt so guilty about the cost of the medicine that I went to gym. $150 is a significant money for my family and I just couldnt sit and wait for it to work on its own, and needless to say I stopped eating any junk.  Oh, my third kid started preschool so it opened up three hours in my day of free time that I am now dedicating to bettering myself. Anyway, I have zero side effects. I just noticed I am not getting hungry as often and able to control the animal in me that was constantly either hungry or having jitters and fainting spells. After ozempic I am eating my last meal at 4pm(mostly eggs wrapped in a tortilla with some hot sauce) and hitting the gym at 9:30am the next morning after taking my kids to school,   and staying at the gym till 11:40am. So basically I am working our for two hours straight on an empty stomach, not walking around the gym checking my phone but actually sweating and pushing myself on the stair stepper and a treadmill. Coming home at 12pm and eating my first meal of the day-again not a huge portion. And I lost already 13lbs. What ozempic is doing for me is enabling me to stick to my gym regimen and making it easier to do intermittent fasting 20:4 and I feel fine. Today I took my fat ass on a run on a treadmill, and I was smiling. I burst out laughing after, and send a message to my husband, I think ozempic is working. Noway in a hell I would be running like this on an empty stomach and feel good about it. I will keep you posted. If I stick to this eating and workout regimen I will shed all this weight in no time and can even run marathons",323,243,2025-02-01T05:06:23,Ozempic,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ozempic/comments/1iesrvf/ozempic_is_turning_me_into_a_super_human/,0.86,True,/r/Ozempic/comments/1iesrvf/ozempic_is_turning_me_into_a_super_human/

1ggiwbw,anamond,"Got mocked by a doctor yesterday. He said I will always be fat, ozempic will fail and that the only option for me is a bariatric surgery. Left in tears.","After struggling with my weigh for the last 15 years, trying everything there is, keto, intermittent fasting, therapy ( a lot of therapy, for the last 3 years and will continue to go because it‚Äôs been the best thing) and tired of failing, and tired of being fat and unhappy in this body of mine‚Ä¶. I decided to do my own research on ozempic. I joined this group and some other groups on Facebook.  I wasn‚Äôt sure first  because the first time I heard of ozempic was in a celebrity gossip channel and they were just trashing everyone, and the terms ‚Äúozempic face‚Äù were mentioned several times‚Ä¶ so I really thought it was just a fad and quite dangerous.

After researching a lot I realized that‚Äôs not the case, and as a woman with endometriosis. PCOS, and insulin resistance, ozempic could be a really good option for me. 
On the last few years I‚Äôve really been in a journey of healing my realism with food, through therapy, I‚Äôve learned to enjoy exercise, I play tenis, I only eat at home because I discovered I don‚Äôt like eating out, seem like everything is there for me to loose the weight but it just won‚Äôt go away.

So, I did all the blood work necessary previously to the appointment and had my appointment yesterday. 
Where do I start? From the first look he took at me he had this face , almost as a little smirk , I explained to him my medical history, showed him my blood work results‚Ä¶ and then he started an endless rant about  how nothing is going to work for me, the amount of times I tried should be an indicator that this is also going to fail.  That the only thing that could work for me is a gastric by pay, because his wife had one, his sister had one and now they are thin and they can eat all the crap they want and won‚Äôt gain weight.

At thing point I think I had a really angry face, üò° because he stoped and wrote a prescription for ozempic and through it at me across the table. And said ‚ÄúI can right you the prescription if you want, but it‚Äôs not going to work‚Ä¶.

And that was it, he didn‚Äôt explain how I should use it, nothing!!! 

I feeling so humiliated, sad and angry. üò§ 
Obviously never going back, and I‚Äôm looking for another doctor, but scared they are going to treat me the same. I hate being fat so much!

It has a wear-off effect (usually around 6 months), and then physiology fights back and then appetite and food noise comes back.

I'm also wondering if I can sort of extend this honeymoon period by titrating up more slowly. (I've just started. My second dose is in 3 days.)

And if that doesn't work, can I ween off Ozempic, sort of grapple with my ravenous 24/7 hunger and lack of satiation, and then go back on Ozempic again?

1j4m95y,BumblingEbullience,"Doctor says Ozempic ONLY works as an appetite suppressant, and nothing else.","I went to my endocrinologist yesterday. I‚Äôve been on ozempic for almost 4 months and have lost 10 lbs. (still on .5 dosage) I told my endo that I‚Äôve been feeling better in general. I am less persistently sleepy, I have more energy, I feel less brain foggy, I wake up more refreshed. It‚Äôs hard to put it into the right words, but I just feel better overall. And she said that‚Äôs only because I‚Äôve lost weight. I told her that I‚Äôve only lost 10 lbs, and I‚Äôm proud of that, but I don‚Äôt think 10 lbs would make this much of a difference. She said she didn‚Äôt know what else it could be since ozempic‚Äôs only function is to be an appetite suppressant, and that‚Äôs the only explanation for me feeling any differently.

In the moment, I didn‚Äôt reply. I was confused. I was put on ozempic because I‚Äôve been prediabetic for years, and I finally crossed that threshold last year. I am not taking it to lose weight. (Although that‚Äôs a great perk with my body‚Äôs ability to hold onto weight.) 

I thought it was initially a type II diabetes drug. Wouldn‚Äôt it do something besides appetite suppression? Come at me with all of it. If I‚Äôm wrong and she‚Äôs right, please tell me.

1g50hcs,itchytoddler,Ozempic is not what I thought it would be,"The way the media makes it sound like, its a magic drug that just lets the pounds shed away. No, it still very much requires willpower, diet, and exercise. It just makes the dieting part easier to do. All the same food triggers are there. I still very much love food. I still have the same food pushers and social food pressures. How much of my eating was just habitual? I can think back to all the nutrition advice I've been given on the past and finally put a plan in action I can handle. Portions don't control me anymore. 

Then I think, am I thinking about food too much? Am I nauseated or hungry? or maybe I should have water? Is this food noise? Eating less than 1500 calories a day seemed like it would be hard. It's not easy, I could eat more, but I don't want or feel the need to. But I'm consciously thinking about these things now. what should i eat? what does my body want?

 The first week, I was in such a good mood. Tonight will be my third shot, and the things that stress & depress me are still there, so that happy mood has waned a bit. Do I think losing weight will lead to happier life? Not necessarily, but it can't hurt. And I'm hoping I won't have to worry about my blood pressure everytime something stressful comes along.

1ieuyqd,One_Cheesecake_516,My colonoscopy results reveal how Ozempic affects my colon,"I am a 59 year-old female who lost 40 pounds on Ozempic.  I went from 185 to 145 in six months. 

After 1 1/2 years of taking .5 mg, I developed fecal impaction.  My feces got stuck in my anus while I was defecating.

So I took a suggestion from some reddit posters to use laxatives.  Dr. Tobias‚Äô 21 day cleanse worked best. 

However, my colonoscopy results from last Friday show that I have ‚Äúhemorrhoids‚Äù and melonatic mucosa at the ileocecal valve‚Äù.  My colonoscopy results from three years ago did not show this.  I also now have diverticulosis. I did not previously have that, either.

My gastroenterologist explained that my hemorrhoids are definitely caused by the chronic constipation I had due to the Ozempic.

The melonatic mucosa condition is caused by chronic laxative use (more than a few months).  According to online research, the laxatives that cause melonatic mucosa aka melanosis coli contain senna, and senna kills the mucosal lining of the large intestine.

WebMD states that most patients with melanosis coli have ‚Äúincreased rates of polyps in their colon‚Äù.  Fortunately, I had no polyps.  

I have not taken Ozempic in three weeks.  I went off it two weeks before my procedure.  Fortunately, I have maintained my weight loss through diet and exercise.  

Anybody out there have abnormal colonoscopy results, such as hemorrhoids, as a result of taking Ozempic?

1kvva0a,CanIGetIsekaidPls,First Month on Ozempic: Lost 9lbs and My Family Says It‚Äôs Not Enough ‚Äî Am I Doing This Wrong?,"Hello everyone! First time posting here (and honestly, first time posting on Reddit in general), so I do apologize if I used any tags or flair incorrectly.

I just finished my first pen of Ozempic, and according to the scale, I‚Äôve lost 9 lbs so far. My starting weight was 200 lbs, and I‚Äôm currently sitting at 191 lbs. I know this isn‚Äôt a huge change, but I was honestly feeling hopeful about the progress.

The issue is, my family keeps on telling me that 9 lbs in a month is too little. That I‚Äôm not trying hard enough. That I should‚Äôve lost more by now. It‚Äôs really demotivating because I have changed my eating habits, mostly thanks to the appetite suppression from the medication and even though I'm not super active, I was making small but intentional changes in my daily routine. 

Sure, I fell off the routine sometimes. I stopped weighing myself daily at one point (This happend after I experienced a slump as my weight remained stagnant, then I gained back 2lbs), I didn‚Äôt eat konjac rice daily as suggest by my family. (I ate normal rice though in much, much smaller portions.) To be honest I thought I was doing good. 

To be honest, it wasn‚Äôt even my idea to go on Ozempic, it was something my family pushed me into. I live in a country where this medication isn‚Äôt that common or widely talked about, (At most, the exposure we get are those ""meme"" pics and videos. So I was basically pushed into it blindly. I still don‚Äôt really know what the dos and don‚Äôts are, and I‚Äôm feeling really overwhelmed. (Tbh it doesn't help that I'm currently struggling with my mental health and juggling my studies as a full time student) 

So I guess I just need to ask‚Ä¶
Is losing 9 lbs in the first month normal?
Or am I truly slacking and need to ""buck up"" like they say?

Any advice, insight, or reassurance would really help. Thank you so much for taking the time to read this. I just need to get this off my chest.

1esz1vx,garcon-du-soleille,Misconceptions around how Ozempic works: Hint‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs not just the calories. ,"In the comments of other threads there are a lot of things being said to the general tune of:

‚ÄúOzempic only helps you lose weight because you eat less while taking it.‚Äù

To be clear:

**All other things being equal (calories consumed, types of calories, time of day calories are eaten, exercise levels, etc) if you do the exact same thing on Ozempic vs off, you WILL lose weight faster with Ozempic than without.**

Here‚Äôs why‚Ä¶

I should add: I am no expert. But I am married to one (MD - family physician who helps a lot of people with weight issues.) And‚Ä¶ before taking this drug myself, I spent (probably too many) hours reading articles online about what I was about to start injecting into me once a week, and what it would do to me. 

First, let‚Äôs address the ‚ÄúCalories In vs. Calories Burned‚Äù idea. We‚Äôve been collectively conditioned to believe that the formula for weight loss is simply to burn more calories than we consume. But there are plenty of studies out there to show us that it just isn‚Äôt this simple. That certainly IS a factor. But it‚Äôs only one of many.  

- Not all calories are created equally. 100 cal of processed and refined white bread will respond very differently once it reaches your gut then 100 calories of chicken.  

- Time of day that you eat matters. Multiple studies have shown that eating the same amount of calories in the morning will result in more weight loss than if eaten at night. 

- it seems like the jury may still be out on intermittent fasting. But there are some studies that indicate that grouping your calories together into less meals results in faster weight loss than spreading their calories out across the entire day. 

- The reason that all of the above matters so much boils down to blood sugar and insulin. Almost every food we eat causes our blood sugar to rise. Some much more than others. Some foods like chicken causes a very low blood sugar rise that last for a long time. White bread on the other hand causes an immediate tremendously high spike followed by a quick crash. (If you want to learn about this, get yourself a real-time blood sugar monitor and watch what happens after eating various kinds of foods. Fascinating!)

I‚Äôm about to boil down every a complicated topic into two sentences: 

1) Frequent high blood sugar levels cause weight gain. 

2) When we eat often, and when we eat foods that cause high spikes in blood sugar, we get fat. 

(Eat this way long enough, and you end up with Type 2 diabetes.)

Ozempic was originally designed to help control blood sugar levels for diabetics. Its origins had nothing to do with weight loss. When it was first created in labs, they did not set out to create a weight loss drug. The goal was to create a drug that, and this is important‚Ä¶

**‚Ä¶Slows down the digestion process so that blood sugar spikes are decreased.**

Its goal is to make our bodies respond to more foods like it does to chicken: A small, hardly  noticeable bump in blood sugar levels that lasts for a long time. Not an immediately high spike, followed by a quick crash.  

Why does this matter? What‚Äôs the big deal with quick high spikes in blood sugar?

For diabetics, it is a serious problem, because their bodies have a hard time regulating insulin levels. When our blood sugar rises, our bodies crank up the production of insulin. And insulin is designed to help bring those blood sugar levels back under control.  But when your body has a hard time regulating insulin levels, or when you develop insulin resistance, then blood sugar levels get out of control. And this causes all kinds of complications‚Ä¶ weight gain being just one of them.

And even for non-diabetics, consistently high blood sugar levels result in fat gain. 

Ozempic does it job! It helps control blood sugar levels! 

But‚Ä¶. (And this is a good but)‚Ä¶ Once diabetics begin taking Ozempic, it didn‚Äôt go unnoticed that they began to lose serious weight as well! 

In addition to helping with blood sugar levels, which has a direct impact on weight, it turns out that one of the side effects is that it also plays with the hormones that control hunger, resulting in a decrease in appetite too. 

The one-two punch of blood sugar control plus drop in appetite makes for great weight loss. And as a result, the makers of Ozempic re-branded the drug to being not just for diabetics, but also as a weight loss drug too. 

Final note‚Ä¶ back to where we started‚Ä¶.

All other things being equal (calories consumed, types of calories, time of day calories are eaten, exercise levels, etc) if you do the exact same thing on Ozempic vs off, you WILL lose weight faster with Ozempic than without. 

**EDIT:**

Adding some links. I should have done this originally. Please note that you should really read the entire articles to gain a full understanding of how this drug works. 

And to be clear! Ozempic is not a magic pill that allows you to eat like sh*t and still become skinny! (Lest anyone think that this is what I‚Äôm saying). 

All of these articles make it clear that Ozempic works by 

1) Changing how we metabolize food

2) AND helping us eat less.

I am now on it again and I feel like I do not feel it as much as I did the first time. Food noise is still here more than ever and I find myself over eating until my stomach feels super full and ignoring my limits. 

Has anyone else experienced this? I am at 1mg and have been on ozempic for about 4 months now and lost maybe 5 pounds.

1jap38f,Distinct_Ad_2544,A message about stigmas for those on Ozempic/Wegovy/etc. for weight loss,"I keep reading posts where people talk about the stigma of using Ozempic for weight loss that they feel. Some are hiding it from their friends and family, just saying they are eating better, etc. 

I've decided that I'm going to tell anybody IRL who comments on my weight, or asks about my diet, weight loss, etc. about the medication I'm on. I'm writing this to encourage you all to do the same.

Obviously I can't know everybody's situation, but misleading others who are battling obesity feeling like failures because they can't seem to lose weight and get healthy, leading to depression, feelings of hopelessness, and worse. So if you can't tell everybody, try to tell those who you know are suffering.

Lets break the stigma. *We have a disease.* A metabolic disorder. For some, it results in T2 diabetes, for others obesity, for many, it's both (for some there are additional health problems). We don't shame people for taking medications for high cholesterol or Parkinson's, so why is there shame associated with GLP-1 medications? My feeling is that people think we are *cheating*, but really it's because their feeling of superiority for being thin is being taken away, and that makes them uncomfortable and bitter.

Lets educate people. Lets help people understand what this medication actually does, and that we all still have to battle for every lb we lose. This is no cake walk. 

Lets share our journeys and normalize them. Lets support those who we can. We could literally be saving somebody's life.

1hr6w6i,happyginny44,Dr took me off of Ozempic ,"I started ozempic in June. I was 239 pounds at 5'8"". Two weeks ago my Dr told me I had lost enough weight to not be on it anymore. Im currently 171 so I lost 68 lbs. I always heard that this was a for life medication. I'm counting calories and carbs and would like to lose 10-15 more pounds. I'm scared that I will gain back everything I worked so hard to accomplish. 

Has anyone stopped ozempic and continued to lose weight? Did you count calories? 

The food noise came back quickly. My appetite is still down some and so far I'm doing ok although I did splurge on Christmas Eve. 

I drink plenty of water so I think that is what is keeping my appetite down.

1fri9jl,FancyPantsMead,I had Forners gangrene and sepsis and was hospitalized almost died. It's a rare adverse effect with OZEMPIC. ,"Exactly what the title said. I've been on it close to 2 years. T2D Got all my numbers under control. I was only taking the 1 mg shot a week (not sure that's the right mg. It makes the biggest pen last two months instead of 1). That's what was working and I didn't want to go higher. No issues at all with it. 

9/14/24-
I noticed a tiny little bump in my groin about pea size no big deal they happen from time to time.  At noon I started feeling like I had the flu. I just went to a kids birthday party the day before so thought  I had picked up the flu. Fever, body aches and so tired. Went to bed at noon. Took some Tylenol and ibuprofen no big deal. I was supposed to take my shot this day but didn't because I've had the flu before while on OZEMPIC and it just made it last way longer, so I didn't want to do it. 

9/15/24
Still not feeling well now I was puking and fever was higher and that bump was about regular marble size now, again it happens from time to time no big deal. Still think flu is getting worse. 

9/16/24
Still sick the bump was bigger figured I'd need antibiotics for it and called the Dr to see if they could call something in. Since I was sick with probably the flu they wanted to see me in office. I went in about 1 pm. We did a flu, covid, strep test and all were negative and she looked at the bump. It was just hard as a rock and about the size of a big marble. She prescribed antibiotics and told me to come back in two days if it wasn't better and they would lance it.  I was too tired to get my meds so had husband pick them up for me after he was off work.  The pharmacist asked my husband what was going on to get prescribed these crazy big , very aggressive types of antibiotics. If the Dr was prescribing these , she should already be in the hospital. So she told husband what to watch out for and brought them home. I started taking them. Didn't feel better but didn't feel worse bump was now about golfball size. 

9/17/24
Husband went to work at 430 am checked on me to see how I was doing.  I was feeling fine. Still fever and sore, feeling like flu but for me, I was fine.   Husband got home from work at 230pm. I was laying in bed white as a ghost, burning up with fever, couldn't think of concentrate had trouble even talking. It all happened so Incredibly incredibly fast. Husband got me in car and rusted me to ER. They started vitals and took me back immediately. They knew right away I was septic. Started all the protocols gave me some pain meds because I hurt so bad all over my body. This point the bump was the side of a pingpong ball. it didn't hurt it was the rest of me that hurt. 

I was life flighted from that hospital to the bigger trauma hospital and wheeled immediately into surgery.  I was entirely septic my kidneys and liver were tanking hard. The bump was growing so fast they ended up cutting a softball size amount of skin, full thickness to get out all the infection and stop it from spreading. It's a crazy fast infection and you can almost watch it grow. Took 3 attempts to make sure they got it all to come back clean from that lab. Then I was left with the gaping hole I my leg/groin area. 

I was CENTEMTERS, from losing my anus and needing a cholosomy bag the rest of my life.  Centimeters from needing to remove genitalia. If husband hadn't acted so quickly it would have been that. I could t make decisions because I was put under. Husband had some very very scary time thinking his wife was dying and I was, they just were able to save me. Husband deserved so much freaking credit for all he's done for me. He seriously was the hero in this situation. He knew every single health issue I have which is extensive, he knew my height weight, meds and dosage,  diagnosis, allergies to meds, I mean ge knew everything. Saving them valuable time I did not have to figure these things out. I discussed all my conditions with him and he knows what's up but I didn't know he knew everything that well. I don't think he did either until he needed the info to be so accurate and correct. Freaking rock star husband. 

I was in the hospital for a week. Being pumped full of meds and keeping that wound open and finally getting a wound vac to come home. I'm so happy and lucky to be alive 
and at home. But I am in a very very long road. I need the wound vac for preferably a month. Twice weekly appointments to redo bandaging. Do you know how hard it is to keep tape on your groin/thigh/buttock/genital area? It's a place that is naturally moist. Since I'm a woman I also have to menstruate in that area. Something that started while I was in the hospital.  

 This is freaking crazy to deal with. The goal is after a. Month we will do the skin grafts to cover the area.    I have a very very long road to recovery.  

This is one of the rare side effects and while it can't 100% be confirmed this happened because of that, it is the most likely way it happened and I am the 3rd patient in 2 years at their hospital to have this same series of events with the OZEMPIC being in the mix. 


Please please please for the love of God of you feel a bump, ingrown hair, cyst, pimple to the groin area and you are on OZEMPIC please for the love of God get it looked at. Don't let it get to be a problem. This all happened lightning fast.   Just keep watching yourself and stay informed.

I stopped taking it a few months ago, and honestly, I felt like I got hit by a truck. Hunger came back hard. I lost muscle. I had zero energy. My mood was all over the place. I felt anxious, foggy, and emotionally off.

I struggled with weight since preteen age, To get down to my ideal weight I had to count every calorie to maintain an ideal weight and work out 1-2 hours a day. This is where the binge eating started to slip into the mix. Between my 2nd and 3rd babies my body dysmorphia and binge eating was out of control. My 4th child was sick most of his first year and it took a toll on my health. For whatever reason, the weight would not come off. I was tested for thyroid and cushings, nothing was found. High blood pressure and sleep apnea. I made peace with the reality that I may be stuck like this and made another appointment with my doctor to see if there was anything that could save me. 

My doctor was the one who brought up Ozempic. I thought it was hard to get but she is a big fan of it and got me started. Had mild symptoms and bumped up to .5 mg after 4 weeks. 

I lost no weight the first 2 months, the 3rd month is when I started to notice I had lost a bit. It took a month of being on 1mg to kickstart my progress. I‚Äôm now down 26lbs (from 211) and I feel phenomenal. I have less joint pain, sleeping better and my blood pressure is coming down! 

I have a ways to go, but I was feeling so discouraged after not losing weight for 2 months I wanted to encourage anyone whose not seeing fast results to be patient and stay positive.

I have a fear that if I tell people I‚Äôm using it that they may have some negative comments/opinions on the matter (which they are entitled to, but I don‚Äôt want that to effect my decision)

I‚Äôve had to take the day off work today because I‚Äôm pretty nauseous but I don‚Äôt really want to tell my boss why (I‚Äôve overheard her, specifically, making fun of people who use it for weight loss and calling them shitty for drying up the supply)

When I first looked into starting it I was offered wegovy or Ozempic by my practitioner (he told me to see if one or the other was covered by insurance and to do some price shopping) and I had considered using wegovy just because the name doesn‚Äôt have the same negative connotation as Ozempic does to some people and that I may be more open to talking about using that one but it was double the price and isn‚Äôt even recognized by the insurance provider as a medication they would consider. 

What have been your experiences about telling people you‚Äôre using it? IMO is none of their business in the long run but I also don‚Äôt want to have to hide it or be secretive about it, especially if it means I‚Äôm going to be having unpleasant side effects like the nausea at work.

1i9lxys,blackaubreyplaza,Hit my goal weight!,"Here are some wild before and current pictures. I started on wegovy in August 2023 and moved to ozempic for insurance reasons. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3‚Äù and my starting weight was 271. I‚Äôve lost 136lbs and made it to the weight I‚Äôm going to maintain, 135lbs, right before vacation last week. 

Happy to answer any questions! But here are the things I‚Äôve seen people ask / talk about over the last year and a half: 

Yes I work out. I‚Äôm the person saying I workout 7 days a week 2x a day. I plan to continue this through maintenance. I also cut out a lot of foods and didn‚Äôt drink for 1 year and 4 months. I did have a couple drinks on vacation but still can‚Äôt get drunk or buzzed. I don‚Äôt think booze will be part of my life while I‚Äôm in maintenance for this reason, and I was formerly an enthusiastic social drinker. I‚Äôm going to lose 10 more lbs before I talk to my doctor about a maintenance dose so I have that wiggle room to figure out what dose will be best. Yes I‚Äôve lost a ton of hair, NO I‚Äôm not any healthier or happier. I‚Äôm not a ‚Äúcompletely different person‚Äù so although you may mean well you can respectfully keep those comments to yourself üñ§! I am still all about fat liberation and total body neutrality.  

Socially no one treats me any different. No one has made any weird comments about my body or weight loss. Dating isn‚Äôt any better, I def pulled more dudes as a class III obese person. Physically I don‚Äôt feel any different, but I didn‚Äôt have any mobility issues previously.

And I'm like: dammit. I've been on it for over a year, lost 40 pounds. I made a mistake in calculations and ended up with no shots for 3 weeks (getting more this week) and I was HOPING my experience would be, ""Hey, I lost all that weight, maybe my brain or metabolism or SOMETHING would be ""fixed"" and I would be ""normal"" and not need to be on this drug for life.""

  
But this is a bleak reminder than I might need to be. Bit bummed out about that.

Mounjaro 15 mg - US Costco = $1072 a month ($1425 without Costco discount). 7 month US supply = \~$7504 USD, compared to 7 month supply prices of $5400 CAD, or \~$4000 USD.

1l9l1hd,Barbapabbi123,Ozempic/Wegovy for us ADHD/low dopamine folks? Dopamine related side effects.,"I tried Wegovy early this year for a few weeks. Felt great, no physical side effects, less fibromyalgia pain. I didn't have ANY appetite before, kinda only ate once per day because I had to. But I drank alcohol daily. I immediately lost all interest in drinking beer, which was the main cause of my weight gain, along with medicine induced weight gain. Lost weight rapidly while I was on it (8kg in one month).

However I noticed that my drive, motivation and joy started lacking around the third week and I felt like the adhd meds just weren't working nearly as well as before. I might have jumped the gun and stopped too quickly, I just got too scared to continue when I found out how long it would take to leave my body and didn't want to feel like this for weeks. Now I'm wondering if it was really Wegovy that caused it or if it was maybe just a hormonal thing (female cycle related), because that happens to me (adhd meds don't work nearly as well in luteal phase) but maybe I wasn't paying attention to my cycle back then and was too focused on Wegovy. 

Has anyone with adhd (on or off meds) or low dopamine for some reason, experienced either worsening mental issues (lack of drive, motivation, joy, socializing, interest in things etc) or that your adhd meds stopped working? If so, what did you exoerience and did you find a solution?

1lomsja,Total-Cheesecake-825,Will Ozempic/Wegovy work on me?,"I feel like I might be a bit of an unusual case.

I'm a young guy still in the first part of my thirties and over the past 8 years, my weight went from 75 kg (165 lbs) to 104 kg (230 lbs). The first 10 kg (22 lbs) came on during my first office job after working in the restaurant business during my student years. It was a typical sedentary job, and I was eating about the same as my coworkers and living a similar lifestyle. The strange part is that they all stayed slim, while I steadily gained weight.

The rest of the weight built up gradually over time. For the past 3 years, my weight has been fairly stable. I don‚Äôt weigh myself often, but whenever I do, it‚Äôs usually somewhere between 215 and 225 lbs.

I‚Äôve had my bloodwork done, and no hormonal issues showed up. However, I was diagnosed with severe sleep apnea, and my doctors believe this may have been a major contributor to the weight gain.

Here‚Äôs what makes my case feel different: I‚Äôm never hungry. I wake up without an appetite and typically don‚Äôt feel the need to eat until 48hours have passed. Don't get me wrong I still eat dinner every evening. Most days that's my only meal. During the day I drink coffee and water. I avoid carbonated drinks like soda because I find them way too sweet. When I go out, I usually drink beers, although I‚Äôve now been off alcohol for about 5ish months. Even with that lifestyle change, my weight has stayed the same.

I‚Äôve been reading other people‚Äôs experiences with Ozempic, and many mention how it reduced their appetite, which led to weight loss. Since I already have no appetite, I‚Äôm skeptical it will make any difference for me.

1l1zw83,Winter-Speed-9667,Thinking about starting Ozempic or Wegovy,"Hi all

I'm thinking about taking the plunge and starting Ozempic or Wegovy soon if I get my doctor's approval. I'm not sure if my insurance will cover it, but I'm at the point where I don't think I care, as long as I can get my husband on board for the expense. I'm looking at going through Felix here in Canada since getting an appointment with my GP here can sometimes take weeks, plus my GP is kind of skeptical about prescribing Ozempic/Wegovy for me since I'm not diabetic. Felix says their plans start at about $320 a month for the pens, plus $40 for online consults/visits with a Nurse Practitioner.  If I go ahead I'm going to shop around a bit to see if there are pharmacies in my area that carry it less expensively, too.

What I'm wondering about is how much the pens cost/month when you're at maximum weight loss dose, I don't want to get started on this only to have to quit if the cost will be prohibitively high. I know the costs vary widely from place to place so I'd like to hear from other Canadians to get an idea of what  the maximum costs might be. 

Secondly, I like to hear from people, particularly women, over 65 and how they found losing weight with GLP-1 as opposed to diet and exercise alone.  My first of countless, lifelong weight loss attempts was over 50 years ago and while I've lost as much as 75 pounds before with diet & exercise, I've had trouble getting past 25 or 30 pounds loss since menopause hit. And ugh those plateaus.  I've had plateaus in the past that I attempted to break through without success despite up to 15 months of honest effort. I'd lose and gain the same 5 pounds over and over again before I finally gave up in frustration and self-loathing.

I'd pretty much given up on ever losing weight again until I started hearing about the GLP-1 drugs and the success people like me were having with them, but I do wonder if my age will be working against me now.  I'm 5'11"" tall, weigh 318 lbs. I seem to be staying steady at this weight after losing 15-17 pounds a couple of years ago after my Covid era high of 335. At my age, I'd be happy to reach 195-200 pounds even if that is still a little high on the BMI charts. I'm lucky to be in pretty good health overall, no diabetes or major cardiac health issues... yet. My blood pressure is in the 125/84 to 139/90 range most days. I do have bad osteoarthritis pain in my shoulders, back, hips and knees and need to use a cane to walk, but I'm hoping I can lose enough weight to improve at least some of the pain and mobility issues.

Anyway, any advice or info other older people can offer would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance.",3,9,2025-06-03T07:17:05,Ozempic,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ozempic/comments/1l1zw83/thinking_about_starting_ozempic_or_wegovy/,0.81,True,/r/Ozempic/comments/1l1zw83/thinking_about_starting_ozempic_or_wegovy/

I wasn‚Äôt the best at balancing my protein and fiber intake at first, nor was I putting enough consistent time in at the gym for strength building. During the holiday season I broke and ate a LOT of sugar and carbs, then went back to being in a calorie deficit in January.

This new year, I‚Äôve noticed I‚Äôm losing significant muscle which has encouraged me to go to the gym more.

This last month, I‚Äôve noticed my hair is starting to fall out. It was subtle thinning at first which maybe started in February but now it‚Äôs significant. I‚Äôm finding hair everywhere and have thin patches on my temples and the back of my head. I‚Äôve done some research and found this is likely due to the shock of dropping the weight so fast, and that it‚Äôs temporary. Has anyone else experienced this and have started helpful treatment? 

I‚Äôm now on an iron/zinc/bcomplex, advanced biotin, glucosamine/chondroitin, and a veggie powder blend capsule. I bought OTC moloxil foam which I‚Äôm kinda sus about but have been trying to use once daily. I‚Äôm trying really hard to up my protein and eat more balanced meals.

1b9xtvl,JapaneseFerret,FDA has approved Wegovy to reduce heart disease risk,"Finally a bit of good news on the semaglutide insurance front.

The FDA today approved Wegovy specifically as a treatment to reduce heart disease risk (reduction of heart disease risk has been a known benefit of GLP-1 meds).

This means that there will soon be a diagnosis other than Type 2 diabetes that can get you covered by your insurance company.

This is particularly relevant to patients like me, who recently lost insurance coverage of Ozempic because I don't have a T2D diagnosis. I also use a GLP-1 med for weight loss because my goal is to reduce my significant heart disease risk and familial risk factors thru a healthy BMI.

I don't want to get too excited too soon but I do hope this means I'll regain coverage. I already sent the news to my doc. I'm currently using HenryMeds, which is great, but the $300/mth price tag is a burden.

I've long been pulling my hair in frustration, and ranted about it here, wondering why so many Americans continue to be priced out of accessing the med despite its significant benefits. Pharma companies are all about the bottom line and it didn't make sense they would refuse coverage of an admittedly pricey drug, but then pay for much much more expensive treatment of obesity-caused chronic diseases down the line, like, to pick an example completely at random, life-threatening chronic heart disease.

Apparently someone with the power to change rx policy in this country finally did the math and agrees with me. I know that's not what happened, but it still feels that way, so I'm gonna take the win.

I've been on Ozempic for 4 months now, and its been a game changer, but its been hard on the budget. I was recently added to my significant other's Healthcare plan. He's in the military, so they use Canada Life as their insurer. My doctor told me that Canada Life will not approve me for Ozepic coverage due to the fact they require me to have T2 diabetes. Which I do not have. But he suggested I try to get covered for Wegovy, that there may be a chance.

personal stats. SW 227 lb, CW 197, BMI 33.2

So I went to Canada Life's website and found the ""Drug Prior Authorization Form"".  I believe I qualify on one aspect with having a BMI over 30, but the form says I have to meet ALL criteria, and it seems confusing. So I'm hoping I can get some inside advice from anyone who has applied to Canada Life for Wegovy - whether you were successful or not, and let me know what happened.

1jtmzpx,weirdogirlyyy,Increasing dose vs switching to WeGovy,"I have been plateauing for about a month and am meeting with my doctor tomorrow to discuss 1) increasing my dose from 1mg, or 2) switching to WeGovy as there's a chance I can get approved for coverage. 

Has anyone switched from Ozempic to WeGovy? I know they are virtually the same but doesn't WeGovy have higher dosages in case I eventually need to go up again? Lastly, can I expect any side effects outside the ones I would experience given I am going up a dose?

  
Background: Began on Jan. 12. I was on .25mg for 2 weeks followed by 2 weeks on 0.5mg. I've been on 1mg ever since and am now plateauing/appetite suppression isn't as strong.

1jhmzws,vibe_ology,Wegovy or mounjaro after one year of ozempic?,I‚Äôve been taking ozempic for one year (currently at 1mg dose). I‚Äôve lost weight gradually over the first 6 months. Little or no change and no appetite supression for the last six months. Neither wegovy or mounjaro were available in my location until this month and 1 mg was the max dose of ozempic available. I would like to lose additional weight and get my bmi down from 27.5 to around 22-23 if possible. What would you recommend ?-  moving to wegovy which is semaglutide at a higher dose or start mounjaro (Doctor says I would need to start it at lowest dose).,0,3,2025-03-23T06:01:16,Ozempic,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ozempic/comments/1jhmzws/wegovy_or_mounjaro_after_one_year_of_ozempic/,0.33,True,/r/Ozempic/comments/1jhmzws/wegovy_or_mounjaro_after_one_year_of_ozempic/

Obviously it‚Äôs not covered by any insurance for solely weight loss purposes as it wasn‚Äôt formally approved for weight loss. I‚Äôve been paying for it out-of-pocket in the meantime. Recently I had my doctor send a prescription for Wegovy in hopes that will be covered since Wegovy is officially approved for weight loss purposes. I have a BMI of 34, and have high blood pressure and high cholesterol. Yet my primary commercial insurance (from my workplace) doesn‚Äôt cover Wegovy either despite my BMI and comorbidities. So they‚Äôre sending in a prior authorization to my secondary insurance, which is Wisconsin Forwardhealth Medicaid Badgercare. Anything else who is on Medicaid have any experience getting weight loss GLP-1s covered? Does Medicaid ever cover such medications for weight loss purposes? According to what I found out, they sometimes do if there‚Äôs a prior authorization going through that meets certain criteria.

1mvhkym,blackaubreyplaza,üö®Maintenance Alert!üö®,"I‚Äôm back! I‚Äôve officially been on a GLP1 medication for two years. So here‚Äôs a little progress update. I‚Äôm going to organize it in a way that addresses most of the questions : topics brought up on this sub.

**BACKGROUND STATS:**  I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2‚Äù and I started on wegovy on August 20th, 2023 at 32 years old and I hit my goal weight in April of 2025. I‚Äôm officially in maintenance. I started at 271lbs and am bouncing between 126 - 129. I‚Äôve since moved to the highest dose of ozempic which I plan to stay on 4 lyfe. 

**HOW:** a lot of this is just that I responded very well to semaglutide. I really benefited from food disinterest and the silencing of food noise. I was also battling insulin resistance and my doctors suspect PCOS but I won‚Äôt get off birth control to get diagnosed. I stopped drinking and cut out: 

- Refined carbs
- Refined sugar
- Red meat
- Anything high fat / greasy / hard to digest

I also ended up with a lot of food intolerances that I‚Äôm sure helped 

I do not do anything in moderation. I‚Äôm very much an all or nothing kind of girl and that‚Äôs how I approached this. I also just have to workout. A lot. I workout 7 days a week, 2x a day. I run 3 days a week (ran 47 miles in May; 56 miles in June; 53 miles in July). I do strength every day. That‚Äôs what has worked for me. I also just straight up do not eat a lot. 

**SOCIAL IMPLICATIONS:** yes everyone I interact with knows I‚Äôm on a GLP1 medication. It‚Äôs even a prompt on my dating apps. No, no one has said anything about my appearance. I feel like there‚Äôs a new post every day where someone is asking how to navigate that and I haven‚Äôt experienced it.

No one is nicer to me now that I‚Äôve lost weight but it is weird meeting people who didn‚Äôt know I was fat because they are not afraid to let their anti fat bias fly. There have also been instances where people forget that I used to be fat which is really a trip. Always very fun to call out both of these people. Dating is also wild. I had a dude dump me when he found out I used to be fat. So I don‚Äôt relate to all of these posts saying people are nicer to them. But I didn‚Äôt let people treat me crazy as a fat person. In fact people probably treat me worse now, or would if I tolerated it.

**OTHER STUFF:** clothing is a nightmare. Straight sized clothing is so ugly to me. I‚Äôve had to replace so many garments and I waited until they were literally falling off of me to start buying clothes, and yet. I also got a ton of clothes tailored but they also don‚Äôt fit the way I feel they should. I have loose skin! I‚Äôm only bringing this up because on my last post a lot of people asked about this. I carried most of my weight in my stomach so I‚Äôm just going to get a tummy tuck. I could probably use an arm and thigh lift as well but I‚Äôm more sold on the tummy tuck. I‚Äôm thinking that will take me from a size 4 to a size 2 or even 0.

**IN CONCLUSION (for now):** I love this community and sharing this with you guys and seeing all of your posts. I respect your perspective about your pursuit of weight loss. Now here‚Äôs mine: I‚Äôve always been a body neutral person. I had never pursued weight loss before. Losing 144lbs is far from the greatest or most interesting thing that I‚Äôve done. My life is not any better now that I‚Äôve done this. I don‚Äôt feel any better physically or emotionally. Honestly, looking in the mirror or catching glimpses of myself is pretty jarring. This doesn‚Äôt negate people who have had opposite experiences but I‚Äôd like to give a voice to those who feel differently. 

Anyway I‚Äôve tried to address most of the things I‚Äôve seen discussed on this sub the last two years. Here to answer any questions if you have any!",594,103,2025-08-20T20:44:11,Ozempic,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mvhkym,0.99,False,/r/Ozempic/comments/1mvhkym/maintenance_alert/

196o4ts,bookiebookbook,switching from Ozempic to Wegovy,"I don't know if this will help anyone but I recently had to switch from Ozempic to Wegovy because I do not have diabetes. My doctor wrote the script and it sat in pending status for weeks. I called the prescription service who said the physician needed to write a preauthorization. It was denied. I got the denial letter and it said that I didn't meet the criteria because my BMI wasn't 27 or 30 (based on health factors) but when I read further it said I would qualify if I was at least 18, had been on the same med and had lost at least 5% of BMI and had maintained the weight for at least 3 months. I more than meet the criteria so they recommended the doctor send in an appeal. Denied again. I called again and this time they gave me all the information the appeal must include and I wrote a message to my physician with everything needed. Again denied. This time when I called the prescription company, they told me that an AI bot reads the preauthorizations and appeals and if certain key words are missing, they are denied, oh, and you are limited to three appeals. They also gave an 800 number for physicians to call to talk to a real person so they can hear the magic words. Seriously, this is not about getting meds to the right people but rather a game with only the insurance company knowing the rules and waiting to see who is determined enough to figure out the game. I hope this helps others. Don't take a denial as the final answer.

1bnxbre,throwawayhkib,Amazing Rybelsus,"

MALE SW: 82kg CW: 70.7kg GW:66.9kg Height: 5‚Äô9

Hi all,

I‚Äôve lost about 11kg since I started Rybelsus back in late October 2023.

There doesn‚Äôt seem to be as much written about the Rybelsus experience and success stories, but since it‚Äôs been cheap, easy and effective for me I wanted to contribute back to the community.

I‚Äôm from the UK, but I travel a lot, so I‚Äôve been making use of time in countries where it‚Äôs easier to pick up semaglutide. I‚Äôve actually got no idea what the situation is in the UK, and would be interested to know. Can you just buy it with a private prescription?

BACKGROUND I‚Äôve struggled with my weight in the past and have used a variety of tactics e.g. keto to get down to a BMI of 22.5, which feels about right for me. Yes I‚Äôm aware BMI is not a perfect measure. I‚Äôve been travelling a lot and that had put me into the overweight range, and closer to obese than of normal BMI. And it showed. It was tricky to deal with as I spend so little time in once place.

GETTING THE DRUG In Spain I arranged a private consult for EUR30 and got a prescription for Ozempic. I then immediately realised (October 2023) that it wasn‚Äôt actually available in this form anywhere in the world. I checked and found that Rybelsus was easily available in Spain.

I also read about the detailed background to cutting the pill written by u/hotcarbypotato here:

https://www.reddit.com/r/Semaglutide/comments/12agm9h/comment/jevxerg/?context=3

With more detail here as provided by this user:

https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Theory-of-oral-semaglutide-absorption-as-advocated-by-Novo-Nordisk-Modified-from_fig4_331093071

If you‚Äôre going to try Rybelsus, I would strongly recommend getting a basic understanding of why peptide-based drugs don‚Äôt generally lend themselves to oral formulation How it follows that semaglutide was first made available as an injection that most drugs are absorbed in the small intestine Why this one is absorbed, VERY UNUSUALLY, through the stomach lining What SNAC which is distributed homogeneously throughout the tablet is doing to allow this to happen (hint - it is not a liner or an extended release formulation).

I promise this stuff isn‚Äôt very hard! There is a lot of coverage on this topic on Reddit and elsewhere, that I‚Äôd say, bluntly, is absolute shite. People seem keen to make stuff up on the spot. If someone thinks Rybelsus is an extended release formulation, you can stop listening to them. Novo Nordisk has been very clear about how this works (obviously! It‚Äôs patented!)

Anyway, I asked my doctor to change my script, got 14mg*30pills for EUR135. I cut my first pill into four for an effective dose of 3.5mg, using a cheap little pill cutter. This gives me an effective cost of EUR1.125 per dose.

STARTING EXPERIENCE I lost my appetite within the first two days, though I‚Äôd put that down to placebo if I‚Äôm honest. You can have a play with how long it takes to build up here:

https://glp1plotter.com/

It worked very nicely. I‚Äôd generally aim for about 1 meal versus 3 in a day. I started in the gym, 1 hour of cardio and 30 minutes of weights. At the start I meticulously kept MFP data and aimed for a deficit of 1000 calories per day, i.e. 7000 calories per week, i.e 1kg of loss per week. It all worked so smoothly I stopped bothering with MyFitnessPal and more or less kept to 1kg loss per week. After a month I felt I was starting to plateau, so moved up to 7mg per day, only cutting the pill in half.

Things did slow down a bit here, honestly I‚Äôd put that down to the food being so good in Spain and lots of our friends liking to meet up and eat as part of their standard social interaction! I got better at ordering smaller, just plain not finishing my food and offering it to other people. Also I like getting a bargain so I had to learn to grit my teeth and go Dutch on the bill even when I really hadn‚Äôt eaten very much!

SIDE EFFECTS Few and far between. I‚Äôd start every day with a protein shake and go to the gym. Maybe 5 times at the gym I‚Äôd feel really queasy and head to the loo in case I was sick. But it‚Äôs never happened. Nasty burps. I do sometimes feel a bit low energy and sluggish, which isn‚Äôt really surprising as it‚Äôs a diabetic medication that‚Äôs lowering my blood sugar and I‚Äôm 1000 calories short everyday.

MEXICO I spent a particularly crazy month after Christmas in a number of countries and just didn‚Äôt bother taking Rybelsus for this time. That was interesting as: I didn‚Äôt pile back on the weight. I was back to where I had been within a week of restarting Rybelsus The time off the drug allowed me to restart at the minimum dose, which I‚Äôm still on after all these months. I wonder if cycling on and off the drug might be very effective and cost-effective for some people.

In Mexico Rybelsus is available everywhere, occasionally with discounts (!?) and doesn‚Äôt require any prescription. When I ran out of my Spanish pills, I bought 30 more 14mgs from Farmacia Guadalajara in CDMX for MXN3900 (maybe USD235, EUR215, GBP190). I‚Äôve been pill splitting just as before since January, and haven‚Äôt felt the need to increase the dose even though it‚Äôs been two months since I restarted.

Mexico seems to lend itself to losing weight quite well! There‚Äôs a taco stand outside my gym and a 20 peso taco often keeps me full for the day.

SUMMARY AND FUTURE PLAN I seem to be living in an alternative universe where semaglutide is easily available and cheap. What I‚Äôve been doing is effectively, drumroll:

cost negative

Because the piffling USD1.90 or whatever each dose costs me is vastly offset by the food and drink I‚Äôm not having.

I am absolutely delighted and would like other people to know this works and is available, which is why I‚Äôm writing this!

My aim is to get down to a BMI of 22.5, and then another 2kg just to give me some breathing space. Per my spreadsheet, and it‚Äôs been very consistent, I should finish that up around mid April and then it‚Äôll really be about adding muscle and losing fat while maintaining my overall weight. At that point I‚Äôm not sure what I‚Äôll do with Rybelsus, either fall back to taking the pill every few days? Or maybe just stop it and see where I am in a few months.

Overall, if it‚Äôs not clear - I am delighted with this drug. What a time to be alive.

Any sensible questions I‚Äôll try to help.",34,1,2024-03-26T08:28:08,Ozempic,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1bnxbre,0.95,False,/r/Ozempic/comments/1bnxbre/amazing_rybelsus/

For reference, I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2. I‚Äôm now 115. I lost 40lbs over 8 months. I started Semaglutide after going to the emergency room with blood pressure 211/105. I thought I was having a stroke. My cholesterol was sky high. My sweet doctor asked if I just wanted to wait for Type II Diabetes before I did anything. He‚Äôs a TOOT!

1lqdjo6,jeffreit,Word of caution,"Hi everyone I've been taking semaglutide for about 15 months. I'm off it now.  I'm a male, 53 years old, 5'8.
I weighed about 218 lbs when I started. I'm down to 185. Not quite as low as I planned. I was hoping for 175.  But a lot thinner than I was. Well here is my warning,  this won't apply to everyone. As a job I'm very active. I'm a ups driver.  I walk around 20,000 steps a day carrying packages.  I lost most of my weight pretty quickly.  
Here is the issue. I lost a lot of muscle mass.  My body fat percentage went from about 32% to about 27 percent. A good amount but I'm still a little chubby. I still have a ""gut"" still have some love handles & still have ""chest fat or man boobs.   My ass is totally gone. My legs shrunk.  I went from a 36 waist to a 36 waist almost no change. 36 was tight. Now it's loose. But I'm not a 34.  
I lost strength, I now have piraformis syndrome.  Google it. It's basically a weak ass.  My glutes ache. My hips ache. I have to sit on a gel cushion at work now. I'm in physical therapy.  Trying to re-strengthen my glutes, hips, ham strings, core etc. 
while talking the shot I drank a lot of protein powder, I ate yogurt, lots of protein. But it wasn't enough.  
My situation is different being that I'm extremely active at work.  I think the shot is mostly good but when I see other people on it, I can see much of the same results,  arms getting shinny, butts & legs getting skinny. Definitely losing weight but is it fat?  Or is it muscle.  If I had to do it again I would work out hard.  Take a lower dose, monitor my fat percentage.  This stuff makes you burn more muscle than fat. There's not a lot of messaging about this but I believe there will be eventually. 

My blood pressure is better, my cholesterol is slightly better but I'm in pain.  & it's because this stuff burns much more muscle than fat.  My recommendation is work out hard if you're taking this stuff.  Osteoporosis is a real thing.",304,227,2025-07-03T07:20:43,Semaglutide,https://www.reddit.com/r/Semaglutide/comments/1lqdjo6/word_of_caution/,0.85,True,/r/Semaglutide/comments/1lqdjo6/word_of_caution/

1cs1qev,Immediate_Humor_1304,AITA Semaglutide Edition ,"For reference, I am 31 F and we have lived together for a year.

My boyfriend ""Peter"" (31 M) is against the use of Sema. He has told me that I am looking for the easy way out, and that I'm essentially cheating.

In February, I brought up the subject and asked what he thought about it, but I was met with a stern ""No"". I've thought about it for a few weeks and brought it up again, still no. Finally, a week or so later I sat him down and explained that it was my decision for the better of my health, and went over my lifelong history of weight issues and struggling with food.

His response was that we are a unit and he needs to have a say. I disagreed, and he did not talk to me for 2 days.

I know I shouldn't have done this, but I went through the process of getting it anyway. Well, he found out soon after and we have been arguing ever since (3 weeks). I tend to hear him lecture me about it for at least an hour weekly, and he keeps giving me restrictions.

Restrictions include: only use it for 2 months. To not go under 200 pounds. If I get to my goal weight of 180, I will be too skinny and unhealthy (I am 5' 11).

I truly don't think he has a say, but I understand real relationships require communication and compromise. I can understand being wary of new medications.

I'd like some insight from others who struggle the same way I do with weight/food. I think a big issue is that he can't empathize with my stance.

Tldr: my boyfriend disapproves of my use of Sema and I am tired of the constant arguments. I received the Medication without telling him and it is causing a rift.

Thank you üôè

Edit: Writing everything out + reading your comments made everything feel so real. 

I feel like a kid, but I ended up taking a walk and calling my mom to tell her everything. She obviously was taken aback, but confirmed that I need to leave. My family agreed to fly over and help me move when the time was right.

I find myself thinking about all of the good moments but I know I have to get out of that mindset. I'm starting my search for a place to stay. Wish me luck.

Update: Well, he found out. I'm guessing he went through my emails. I don't want to go into details, but it was a very scary night. I was able to leave thanks to a friend intervening. I'm at a hotel, but if anyone knows of affordable temporary housing in the Omaha area while I try to secure an apartment, it'd be really, really appreciated.",361,320,2024-05-15T01:36:25,Semaglutide,https://www.reddit.com/r/Semaglutide/comments/1cs1qev/aita_semaglutide_edition/,0.97,True,/r/Semaglutide/comments/1cs1qev/aita_semaglutide_edition/
1hzwrix,Bizzzybear,For Anyone Not Seeing Results on Semaglutide ‚Äì My Experience,"I just wanted to share my experience for anyone feeling frustrated with slow results on semaglutide. When I started this journey, I was so excited. I obsessively read about how quickly others were losing weight and how life-changing it had been for so many people. I couldn‚Äôt wait to experience the same.

In my first week, I was prescribed the 0.25 mg dose, it did absolutely nothing for me. I had a few mild side effects, but strangely, I found myself craving food more than usual. I ended up eating more and actually gained 3 pounds that first week! I was devastated and kept scrolling through Reddit posts, trying to figure out what was wrong with me.

After doing some research, I learned that the 0.25 mg dose is just a trial dosage to help your body adjust. Even so, it was incredibly frustrating. I stuck with it as best as I could worked out, ate a bit healthier but I still struggled with bingeing.

I reached out to my provider and explained what was happening. Since I wasn‚Äôt experiencing any significant side effects, they allowed me to move up to the 0.5 mg dose earlier than scheduled. I thought this would be the moment everything turned around. But again, no. The cravings were gone, but I didn‚Äôt feel full after eating. I was still eating like I always had, and the only noticeable side effect was sleepiness.

At this point, I felt like an outlier. Of course, I thought, this wasn‚Äôt going to work for me‚Äîit was too good to be true. Watching others post their amazing results while I felt like I was wasting my money was incredibly discouraging. Especially since I was paying for it out of pocket. I even considered switching pharmacies, thinking maybe my medication wasn‚Äôt working properly.

I stayed on the 0.5 mg dose for a whole month and only lost 3 pounds just enough to bring me back to my starting weight. I felt hopeless. This was supposed to be my last resort after trying everything else.

Finally, it was time to move up to the 1 mg dose. I started it on a Wednesday and noticed a small change in my appetite, along with mild nausea and drowsiness. Then on Friday, something incredible happened. I woke up starving, ran downstairs to eat breakfast, and after just a few bites, I felt it I was full. For the first time ever, I wasn‚Äôt constantly thinking about food. The appetite suppression finally kicked in, and the ‚Äúfood noise‚Äù was gone.

Now, a month later, I‚Äôm finally seeing consistent progress. I‚Äôve started losing weight, and I finally feel like I can relate to the stories I‚Äôve read from others.

I wanted to post this for anyone who feels like an outlier, wondering why it‚Äôs not working for them. It‚Äôs so hard to stick with it when you‚Äôre not seeing results, but every body is different. Sometimes it just takes time for your body to adjust.

1mlo62f,BreatheBold,Microdosing Semaglutide has unexpectedly improved my mental health.,"I‚Äôm 45, deep in perimenopause, and have been dealing with PMDD, anxiety, and intrusive thoughts for what feels like forever. I‚Äôm on an estrogen patch (twice weekly) and topical testosterone, but I‚Äôve never taken anything for anxiety or OCD because I hated the side effects of the usual meds.

Recently, I started microdosing Semaglutide‚Äînot for mental health, but just to drop a few pounds and hopefully ease the hot flashes. I can control my own dosage, so I‚Äôve been taking much smaller amounts than what‚Äôs typically prescribed.

Here‚Äôs the surprise: within weeks, I noticed I was calmer, more focused, more present. The jittery anxiety, racing thoughts, and obsessive mental loops‚Ä¶ just gone. It‚Äôs like someone turned down the internal static I didn‚Äôt even realize was always blaring.

I have no idea if this is purely from the stabilized blood sugar, appetite suppression, or something else‚Äîmaybe just better hormonal balance‚Äîbut it‚Äôs honestly remarkable. I didn‚Äôt expect this at all.

1hgootp,Aware_Negotiation605,Semaglutide gave me the clarity I never thought I‚Äôd have about food,"
My entire life, I‚Äôve been baffled by people who could just choose an apple over a bag of chips, save candy for later, or genuinely prefer salad over fries. I‚Äôd always think, how?

For me, the crunch of chips, the sweetness of my favorite candy, or the salty satisfaction of fries with ketchup felt like something I needed. If I didn‚Äôt have it, I felt like I couldn‚Äôt breathe.

This led to years of restrictive dieting and shame. I‚Äôd think, ‚ÄúWhy does my brain demand this when everyone else seems to have self-control?‚Äù I‚Äôd push myself to diet, hyper-fixate on ‚Äúbad‚Äù foods, and eventually crash‚Äîbingeing harder than ever before.

Then I started semaglutide a week ago, and now I get it.

I‚Äôm not obsessing over chips or angrily digging through cabinets for some forgotten holiday candy. I don‚Äôt feel like I need to fight with myself over food anymore. For the first time, I see food as neutral‚Äîjust food.

I‚Äôve always known how to diet. I know how to count, measure, and track calories. I know nutrition. I just couldn‚Äôt use those skills because my brain wasn‚Äôt cooperating.

This past week has shown me what it‚Äôs like to not be at war with food, and it‚Äôs incredible.

1lrosp4,Cynicusme,Is there a stigma about the use of Semaglutide for weight loss?,"My wife and I recently started taking Wegovy for weight loss, as we both had a BMI slightly over 30. We've also be doing CrossFit five times a week for the past two months and going for a hike every Saturday.

I've noticed my wife never mentions the semaglutide when people ask her about her weight loss. Last week, our trainer congratulated us on our body transformations after class. Someone then asked if we were seeing a nutritionist. I was honest, explaining, ""Yes, we have a dietitian, we take Ozempic, and we work out six times a week.""

Immediately, I noticed people staring at us, and there were several ""ooh, that makes sense"" and ""now it all adds up"" comments, followed by a flurry of questions about side effects. I'll admit I'm not great at picking up on social cues, but it was clear their perception of us shifted. These are the same people who've seen us show up at 5 AM every day, and now they look at us differently. 

Today, we were weighted, we do weigh-ins every Friday, and it was all attention on us, and a mix of stares and questions about the effects of Ozempic in the body and comments.

While I personally don't care much, I'm genuinely curious if this kind of reaction is normal.",118,114,2025-07-04T23:14:35,Semaglutide,https://www.reddit.com/r/Semaglutide/comments/1lrosp4/is_there_a_stigma_about_the_use_of_semaglutide/,0.92,True,/r/Semaglutide/comments/1lrosp4/is_there_a_stigma_about_the_use_of_semaglutide/
1m8u6y0,NelWasTaken,Semaglutide changed my life,"I am a 38M unmedicated ADHD individual that had to start semaglutide (wegovy) due to high cholesterol and fatty liver. I was 108kg (238lbs) when I started. Currently at 81kg (178lbs) on my 6th month.

The weight loss is definitely a bliss and the most noticeable change. My old clothes do not look good anymore on me. I now wear tighter clothes, things I always wanted to wear that didnt look good on me when I was heavier. My face has gotten skinnier and my double chin is gone. Everyone tells me I look good and I have noticed the increase in sex appeal with the ladies. That‚Äôs consistant with what I expected, no surprises there.

Now onto the surprises: Wegovy has literally changed my life. 

I used to be a heavy smoker of both weed and tobacco. I used to smoke daily. Now I don‚Äôt smoke except whenever I feel like it and that‚Äôs on special occasions. I didn‚Äôt even *try* to quit, it just happened. One day I woke up and I thought: wait I have not smoked in a week. Then I shruged and kept on with my day. Crazy!

I used to be a heavy drinker of coke (ADHD + tasty high sugar + caffeine, a classic) to the point I‚Äôd drink almost 2L daily.
One day I just‚Ä¶ didn‚Äôt feel like it. I now don‚Äôt really drink coke except socially or when I go out. Most of the times I drink water (me?? Water???? What is this magic) but also drink isotonic drinks to stay hydrated(very important btw this drug will dry you like a desert).

I used to be lazy. Very very lazy. Stay at your computer doing something all day type of lazy. Now I just cant be on my PC. Even if I feel like doing things like play videogames I used to play or watch series while on socials‚Ä¶ I just don‚Äôt find it as fun anymore. I am waaaay more active. Walk 10k+ steps a day and love to just go on long walks on my city. I even do callisthenics because I feel like it! One day I decided to try to get more muscle and it was a fantastic experience I just wanted more. Me! A person that would literally HATE any type of physical activity. Just wow.

Alcohol? No more! I only drink socially now, forget about drinking every weekend or at home when I‚Äôm bored. I don‚Äôt take a sip at home anymore I just don‚Äôt feel like it.

My tastebuds changed. I used to HATE certain foods now I thrive eating them. Greasy foods do not make my head go crazy for them anymore. Mcdonalds? Sure once in a while but just if its convenient otherwise I will be spending time cooking myself things I never even tried.

I used to snore like a pig to the point my partners would have trouble sleeping with me. I also used to sweat a lot during intercourse and when hugging them being big spoon which made me very self-conscious.
Now? Nothing. No snore, no sweat. Zero. Nada.

And ultimately and probably one of the biggest things that this thing has done for me: My ADHD is better??? Like I do not understand but I am very much capable of focusing, doing tedious tasks for my job, being on time for things and overall having a healthy relationship with my cravings for dopamine. Again, I am an unmedicated male that got diagnosed late (33) so this is absolutely insane and a life changer for me! Never in my life I felt like a normal human being in terms of productivity. Gone are the days spent on ADHD paralysis! Now it can happen but way less intensity and usually goes away if I put a bit of effort which before was absolutely impossible.

Now don‚Äôt get me wrong I have had my share of issues specially with the jump to 1,7mg due to nausea and constipation but when I realized that all I had to do was make sure I stay hydrated or take a probiotic to help whenever I feel like food is starting to rot in my stomach rather than be digested, those went away and my life is now a bliss! I also make sure when I‚Äôm gonna have a heavy day (greasy dinner + drinks after) I take a stomach antiacid (omeprazole) as prep and there we go! No issues whatsoever. Constipation is a bitch because I was used to go 2/3 times to the bathroom before so my brain is still stuck on the ‚Äúyou need to go‚Äù mode and I often sit down only to not do anything and then leave with a weird sense of relief but at the same time frustration because I didn‚Äôt really release but hey, that‚Äôs a small price to pay for the benefits!

This drug has changed how I interact with life and with myself and I really can‚Äôt be thankful enough for what it has done for me. I know everyone is different but I recommend it to everyone I know that could benefit from it now! It has really brought a new life to me and I am afraid to reach my goal weight and maybe getting off it. I would NOT want to go back to before taking it, never ever. So hopefully I can stay on maintenance for a long long time and hopefully one day this me is the one to stay even without sema.


And to everyone out there: Keep pushing! This drug really deserves all the praise it gets at least from my experience so keep fighting and I hope you all get to the point I am now because I feel I am at my prime.

1etwh06,maeasm3,I think my therapist shamed me for taking semaglutide?,"As the title suggests, I think my therapist shamed me for taking semaglutide. 

We were discussing various medications and some fears of mine surrounding the medicines side effects (specifically mental health medication). He went on a mini rampage about the ""other"" medications I take and if I had looked into the side effects from those. He then goes on to mock me, pretending to jog and says ""but oh no when it comes to weight loss medications you were first in line for that!"" Shaking his hands around aa if to emphasize how desperate I was for it?

... I was speechless. First of all, I wasn't first in line for anything? It's not like I've been beating down the door for the medicine and complaining in his office about how much I want it? I literally never mentioned it before except that session to tell him I started taking it (so he can track all of my medicines for insurance purposes or whatever). 

I've spent days thinking about and feeling shame and embarrassment. Why did he say that and do that? For someone who advocates for ""stigmatized medications"" such as mental health medications, saying they are just another ""tool in your toolbox"", he sure needs to work on his internalized stigma against weightloss medicine.

Am I thinking about this wrong? I mean I understand the point he was trying to make about me taking some meds while having fears of others but... why mock me? Why act like I've just been gnawing on the bars of my enclosure waiting until I could get my hands on the coveted Ozempic! üòû",228,191,2024-08-17T00:08:41,Semaglutide,https://www.reddit.com/r/Semaglutide/comments/1etwh06/i_think_my_therapist_shamed_me_for_taking/,0.97,True,/r/Semaglutide/comments/1etwh06/i_think_my_therapist_shamed_me_for_taking/

This is partially due to the fact that is makes me SO SICK every time I drink. 

But I thank God it's helped me. I use to drink a handle of vodka in 3 days for 6 years. Now I'm drinking a little bit on social occasions like once a month. I've pretty much quit completely, I'm actually a little scared to drink now because it makes me so nauseated. Just one shot can make me throw up. And I can't digest the alcohol quick enough to even catch a buzz. 

To some who don't have a problem with alcohol this may sound like a bad thing, but for me I couldn't make myself stop drinking no matter how guilty it made me feel. I needed to be pushed to stop drinking. 

How are you guys doing?

I remember once we broke up a few years ago and that literally killed me, but now its different and nothing technically has changed.

Now i was reading a study that shows how semaglutide works for alcoholism, drug addicts, gamblers and sex addicts and then it hit me. Losing your loved one is exactly like when you are and addict and you dont have your drug (im a doctor, so i know about this) so then i realized that thats probably why im not feeling the breaak up. I quit drinking, gambling, super easy once i started on this medication and now i quit my relationship without hesitation so im almost certain that the reason why im not feeling it its because of semaglutide...

Since starting semaglutide, I‚Äôve completely lost the desire to drink alcohol, and I actually have to force myself to eat. I‚Äôm averaging maybe 1,200 calories a day now, if that.

After reading the book Ultra Processed People in early July, my perspective on what I perceived to be healthy food changed, and so did my eating habits. I lost the first 24 pounds by cooking all my meals and avoiding foods with ingredients I wouldn‚Äôt find in a kitchen. When I hit a plateau in February, I decided to start taking semaglutide.

1fbynd2,throwaway6365account,I‚Äôve lost 50 pounds without changing anything other than taking semaglutide,"I‚Äôve been tracking my calories for years everyday in a spreadsheet and on a food scale. I weighed everything I ever ate. I hardly ever ate out and when I did I was pretty good at estimating. 

I started out at BMI 26/27 and am now BMI 19. It‚Äôs worth noting I wasn‚Äôt overweight long. My normal weight my entire life was BMI 18.5/19 I am early 30s 5‚Äô10‚Äù female. I suddenly gained 40-50 pounds out of nowhere without any seeming reason which is how I got fat. I tried for the entire 2-3 years that I was fat to lose by counting every calorie and working out for hours a day. I didn‚Äôt lose any weight. When I did lose weight I‚Äôd immediately gain it back. 

Ever since starting semaglutide 8 months ago I have lost 50 pounds. I stopped working out completely. I went down from 2 hours of cycling or 1 hour running a day to zero. I walk maybe 2-3 miles 3 times a week and that‚Äôs it. I sit on my ass the rest of the day. I noticed on my tracker app that my calories are MORE on semaglutide. Before sema I had to eat 1500 a day to lose. And ofc I would gain it back a day later. Now I‚Äôm eating 2100 calories a day and losing 0.5-1 pound a week. I‚Äôm done losing finally. 

I barely seem to have lost much muscle and I have no stretch marks or loose skin. I‚Äôm wearing a size 2 and my waist is 25 inches. All of this without even working out. No starving etc. This has truly been a miracle. Feels so crazy that I‚Äôm done ü©∑

Edit- wanted to answer as many questions as I can here are 2 I saw a lot 


1) yes I ate the exact same foods I actually ate way worse foods which had been off limits for years for me. For the first time in years I let myself eat candy, chips etc 

2) I don‚Äôt plan to go off for a long time but if I do I highly doubt someone like me who was always super skinny won‚Äôt have the same struggles most likely as someone who was always obese etc. I plan to stay on for years at least 1-2 years if not forever. Seeing as how I‚Äôm at goal, that‚Äôs 2 ish years at goal on the drug. I highly highly doubt I will gain after that. If I ever went off and started gaining weight I‚Äôd go back on immediately with the first 5 pounds gained. I pay out of pocket and obtaining it isn‚Äôt an issue for me

What did you do when the highest dose of semaglutide stopped working as well?

I‚Äôve been on semaglutide for about a year and on the highest dose for the last 6 months. It‚Äôs been amazing for me! I‚Äôve lost weight, built healthier habits, and I work hard to support it! I focus on protein and fiber, drink about 124 fl oz of water daily, get 10k steps, and lift weights 4 days a week.

But lately‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve noticed my food noise creeping back in, and honestly, it‚Äôs freaking me out. Last night, all I could think about was licorice (haven‚Äôt craved it in forever). Today, someone mentioned preferring fruit over Doritos, and now all I can think about are Doritos.

I used to be a binge eater and struggled with depression, so the idea of my old patterns coming back terrifies me. I‚Äôm still trying to make good choices and stay mindful, but I‚Äôd love to hear from others. 

Did you hit a point where the highest dose wasn‚Äôt as effective anymore? 

What helped you manage the cravings and keep your progress?

Did you adjust your dose, switch meds, change up habits, or something else?

I have zero craving for anything deep fried and unhealthy. Like it has fully changed how I see food and if I‚Äôm hungry I tend to crave something fresh and nutritious. 

The biggest thing I‚Äôve noticed since my break from semaglutide and the return is my spending habits.. I just don‚Äôt seem to want to spend money on anything and just aimlessly buy things which has always been a problem in my life.

1c1klmo,anxious_girly24,Started Semaglutide and haven‚Äôt told a soul,"So i‚Äôve been on semaglutide for a week. Friday is my second injection. I haven‚Äôt told a soul, not even my husband.

Recently while getting together with his family, the topic of ‚ÄòOzempic‚Äô and other weight loss drugs were brought up. My husband made a comment somewhere along the lines of ‚Äúthose drugs are for lazy people who want the easy way out‚Äù.. and that made me not want to tell him. 

Back in 2020 i lost 100lbs naturally through a calorie deficit and working out. i went from 265-159 in a year. I also have a diagnosed binge eating disorder, and in 2023 i was struggling with my job, and it was making me so depressed, i started binging again and i‚Äôm back to 200lbs. I started the medication to help with cravings, so far it is helping, but only the first week so i see no change in weight just yet. 

I have been rather tired and sore lately (i‚Äôm assuming due to my body trying to get used to the drug, and possible side effects) and it‚Äôs just hard to try and explain or communicate to him why i‚Äôm feeling the way i am, changes in eating habits, etc. I don‚Äôt like lying or hiding things from him, but now i feel insecure about the whole thing, and i‚Äôm not sure what to do.

1jo4fy2,Beginning-Willow-801,Is Drinking More Water the Secret to Better Results on Semaglutide?,"I think one lesser known secret to getting better results on Wegovy is drinking A LOT of water every day. I myself have noticed this on my journey and I found it's a pretty simple way to get better results.

Drinking more water helps you lose more weight because:

* Reduces side effects from GLP-1 medications (especially constipation and nausea)
* Helps maintain energy levels and cognitive function
* Supports kidney function for processing medications
* Promote healthy digestion
* Supports your metabolism and weight management

I think the general estimate we were told as kids to drink 8 cups of water a day is probably not enough water for most people on a GLP-1.

How much is enough water every day? It depends on a number of variables including your age, activity level, weight, climate etc.

The math gets pretty complex so I created a free Drink More Water calculator that calculates a personal estimate for how much water people on GLP-1 journey should drink daily to lose more weight.  
[https://glp1tribe.com/water-calculator](https://glp1tribe.com/water-calculator)

One good rule of thumb is half your body weight in ounces of water each day. On top of that, many healthcare professionals have suggested people on GLP-1 should drink 10% more water than the normal person. But the reason for the calculator is when you factor in all the variables we should probably drink a lot more water than we think.

\- Consider using one of the cool bluetooth water bottles that connects to an app and tracks your daily water consumption.

\- One thing I have found helpful is drinking small sips of water all day instead of a lot at once.

\- Watermelon is great because it's 92% water!

The good news is testing if drinking more water improves results is free and easy thing for everyone to try.   I hope this is helpful for others.

Seeing some studies that show people that stay on the same diet and exercise programs after stopping a Semaglutide they gain back significant weight. is this just a reality when going on a Semaglutide or is there not enough information yet to make a informed decision?

My weight is the issue, I have Fatty Liver and need to lose significant weight that when I was younger was easy. I could make a minor change to diet and work out 3 times a week and the weight would fall off. not nothing seems to work.

1f3h969,Lazy_Law9851,Horrible Semaglutide withdrawal symptoms ,"Let me first just say that the past 3 wks have been a nightmare. I‚Äôve been off of Semaglutide for approximately 5 weeks today. I caught Covid while on vacation and decided to stop the medication since I had so much going on with that. My symptoms while on the medication weren‚Äôt too bad but still concerning enough that I knew I wouldn‚Äôt be on the drug long term. For context I started February 2024- July 2024. 3 weeks ago I woke up with blurry vision and felt really weak. Next thing I knew my heart was racing, fingers tingling, mouth tingling, sweating, shaky, light headed and just felt completely outside of my body. I was also getting headaches which is not normal for me given I don‚Äôt get them often. The blurry vision definitely freaked me out because I have very good vision and knew something wasn‚Äôt right. I went into the ER and was seen right away. They did some blood work and an ekg. Turns out my magnesium levels were low and my blood glucose was at 71. Which for me is pretty low. They started me on a magnesium IV drip and sent me on my way. I went home still feeling horrible. I made an appointment with my doctor who knows about my semaglutide use and was told this could just be side effects from long Covid or semaglutide. No other help what so ever. Long story short in one week I‚Äôd been to the ER 4 separate times from those symptoms with still no answers. Another doctor looked at my glucose levels from over the span of those ER visits and what my past history is and felt that when my levels dropped down to 71 I should been considered hypoglycemic. When I read up on all of the symptoms it‚Äôs exactly what I‚Äôve been experiencing. My doctor explained that I am not diabetic and these symptomatic hypoglycemia is likely from the Semaglutide. My question is for anyone who has experienced this how long did these withdrawals or symptoms last after getting off of the medication? I can‚Äôt workout, leave my home for extended periods and if I don‚Äôt eat first thing in the morning + around the clock I start to feel like I‚Äôm going to pass out with all the symptoms I shared above. My vision is still blurry off and on (more on than off). I pray someone has answers that can provide some sort of relief or light at the end of the tunnel. I now regret ever touching that drug.

13x3iq8,TwinMamaCita,"You‚Äôre not going crazy, semaglutide skin sensitivity is a thing","I‚Äôve been on Ozempic for 7 weeks now and the 0.5mg dose for the past 3 weeks. This past week I‚Äôve developed skin pain/sensitivity on my left thigh and outer half of the bottom of my left foot. At first I thought it was from working out (I run on the treadmill regularly), but after checking here, I see that others have felt this too. For me it feels like a bruise, and if I even gently touch it the pain feels worse, kind of like a burning sensation. Maybe a 1-3 on the pain scale.

From what I‚Äôve read, no one has seemed to figure out a remedy. The pain isn‚Äôt enough to make me stop or lower my dose, but it is pretty annoying that I have to avoid touching it, clothes rubbing, or my 11 month old twins touching my leg.

Anyone else experiencing this and figured out how to make it go away?

UPDATE 10/23: this lasted for about a month while I was on the 0.5mg dose and then went away completely. I‚Äôve been on the 2mg dose for 3 weeks now and into my 2nd week this feeling has come back. Hoping it just goes away again!

UPDATE 4/24: I was on 2mg up until December 2023‚Ä¶after the first 4 weeks on that dose, the tingly sensation went away and didn‚Äôt return. I‚Äôve been off Oz altogether for about 2 months now (due to shortages and coupon no longer working but trying to find a way to resume, will update if when restarting from the lowest dose the feeling comes back!)

UPDATE 5/24: I restarted Oz about a month ago at the 1mg dose (don‚Äôt recommend unless you have a a strong tolerance for nausea lol), the tingly sensation has not returned at all. Will update if it does when I go up to 2mg, but so far so good!

UPDATE 7/24: It‚Äôs baaack üòÖ upped to the 2mg a day ago and and I‚Äôm feeling it again (I had also failed to refill my script for 3 weeks and jumped straight from 1mg to 2mg) This time it‚Äôs on my right hamstring and a little on the bottom of my right foot. It‚Äôs not terrible or nearly as bad as when it first happened, but still noticeable. This must be a thing when titrating up on doses.

1lwkbq9,Maleficent_Sea3061,Has anyone experienced suicidal thoughts or severe depression after taking Semaglutide (Ozempic/Wegovy)?,"Important note: It was prescribed for diabetes, their weight was healthy when they started taking it.

Edit: I understand the medication is beneficial to people and fully support anyone taking it when it is helping them.

My friend died by suicide within months after starting Semaglutide (Rybelsus) for diabetes ‚Äì has anyone experienced mental health side effects?

It seems to be a 'growing' area of interest with no clear answers. The drug acts on brain receptors, affects the reward system (dopamine) and changes lifestyle habits so I think there's a link.

People trust what is being prescribed to them for diabetes. They had a history of depression, but no suicidal ideation, two kids and a wife - my friend was in his 60s - obviously rapidly lost weight.

The research shows it has an impact on dopamine, there are GLP-1 receptors in the brain, it obviously impacts mood. However, there are not many clinical trials or real-world data around the medication and suicidal ideation. This is for a few reasons:

\- You can't really ethically test on people with this history, especially if the drug being prescribed is for something other than mental health

\- Real-world data would rely on family or friends making the link between GLP-1 and problematic mood / ideation

\- Suicide is complex

\- Much of the current research is funded by the drug companies

There IS research showing a link between mental health and semaglutide, some showing it as having a positive affect. I think this is a red flag, as if it affects some people positively, it's bound to affect others negatively, just like literally everything else.

I was 260lbs. I felt helpless, the food noise was super loud because my feelings were super loud. So I was like ‚Äúwhat the helly, time to save my life‚Äù. 

When I started - I was not sure if I could do this. I would feel not so good and I felt tired allllll the time. But as I saw the scale going down - I said to myself ‚Äúthis is worth it‚Äù. So, I kept going. Pound by pound. Brick by brick. Slowly - I started to feel really damn good. 

Today - I have lost 40lbs total at 220lbs. I have not been this weight since high school (I am 30 year old female). I have been consistent. I drink my water, I force myself to eat protein. My pants got so big for me, I had to go buy new ones. Lol. I get compliments from co-workers who I see here and there, they are like ‚Äúomg you have changed‚Äù. I‚Äôm brutally honest with them and say I‚Äôm on the shot. But I am also filling my body with better, staying away from greasy food cause that sucks, and I drink water. Everyone is so proud of me.

So anyone reading this - don‚Äôt give up. Keep going. I say this - cause I don‚Äôt know where I would be if I never started.

zup0m0,Cheap-Safe,Have you noticed depression or mood changes after taking Semaglutide?,"I‚Äôve suffered from situational depression for many years now. I‚Äôm not good at handling stress. I‚Äôll get overwhelmed and get in a severely depressive mood for 3-7 days maybe every couple months. 

Since starting semaglutide injections (6th week I believe), I‚Äôve dealt with these depressive moods every week. They last about 3-4 days after taking the injections. They‚Äôre so random and I think the randomness makes the depression stronger because I get annoyed at the fact that I‚Äôm so randomly sad and unmotivated and so affected by little things. I won‚Äôt go on a big rant here, but this is really affecting my life and relationship. Has anyone else had this from semaglutide? I did a quick google search and saw that depression is a rare symptom of semaglutide, so I just wanted to see if anyone else is having the same experience.

Update 5/24/24:

I stopped sema many months ago. My normal mood and energy returned about 2-3wks after my last dose. I‚Äôve began taking Tirzepatide. My terrible insurance didn‚Äôt cover it, but I was able to get it online. Just took my 4th dose yesterday. I have not noticed any effects on my mood. No depression at all! I‚Äôm sure everyone‚Äôs experience is different. But definitely worth a try if you‚Äôve stopped or will be stopping sema. 

I didn‚Äôt expect this post to get so many responses. So happy it could bring clarity to so many of you. It also helped me a lot, because I thought I was the only person experiencing this! Thank you all for sharing your experiences. Please continue to share and know that you are not alone. Talk to your doctors about your options.

Sorry my responses have been low lately. Still on Tirz. I‚Äôve been extremely depressed for the past 6 months or so. It‚Äôs been on and off.

1dkvb15,oxtour,Update - 9 months after stopping semaglutide,"Honestly, I wanted to make this post a month after I stopped Wegovy, but I was nervous I‚Äôd gain the weight back and the internet strangers I see criticizing semaglutide would be right.

I started Wegovy in April of 2023. My starting weight was 272 lbs. 

Taking semaglutide changed my life in every aspect of the sense. The chronic anxiety I struggled with disappeared. My binge eating immediately ceased for the first time in 14 years. My number one coping mechanism was torn away from me, but the best thing was - I didn‚Äôt care. I didn‚Äôt enjoy food - it became simply a necessity to living. I had to find new coping mechanisms pretty quickly, but thankfully I went through an outpatient program for my eating habits the previous year, and I was finally able to fully implement the skills I learned there. (Even with that treatment, I could never fully drop my eating habits). 

I finally felt like I understood my body and the way it handled food. 

During the end of September 2023, I upped my dose and could not tolerate it. I had been dealing with the regular symptoms beforehand, but after that particular change, I was nauseous all day, every day for two weeks, and decided I‚Äôd take a break. I was frustrated with the shortage as well, and wanted to see how I‚Äôd feel off of the drug. 

When I stopped taking Wegovy in September 2023, I weighed 230 lbs. 

January 2024 I weighed in at 210 lbs. 

The 20 lbs I lost after stopping Wegovy were slower to come off then the previous 40, and I‚Äôve been steady at this weight now for the past 6 months. 

Semaglutide is not an easy or temporary fix. Everyone gains and loses weight, it‚Äôs part of life - but what this drug does is give you a chance to start over. A clean slate. To get to know your body, the way it digests, when you feel full. It was like the final puzzle piece fell into place one day, when I realized that pre-Wegovy, I thought I was ‚Äúfull‚Äù when I literally gorged myself on food. Overeating was a form of self-harm. And I didn‚Äôt even realize it. 

Now, my biggest motivation is the way I feel. If a food makes me feel bad - I don‚Äôt want to eat it. If I‚Äôve had enough - I feel it in my body, and my body and mind no longer feel satisfied with overeating and binging.

Don‚Äôt let any internet strangers scare you with the whole ‚Äúyou‚Äôll gain it back immediately!‚Äù BS. Even if you do - it‚Äôs OKAY. It‚Äôs okay to need sema as a long term aid. It‚Äôs okay to go off of it and then go back on. It‚Äôs your body and you make the rules. I just want to give some people hope as well. The drug is a tool, but YOU are the real power here.",650,46,2024-06-21T09:51:24,Semaglutide,https://www.reddit.com/r/Semaglutide/comments/1dkvb15/update_9_months_after_stopping_semaglutide/,1.0,True,/r/Semaglutide/comments/1dkvb15/update_9_months_after_stopping_semaglutide/

For anyone further along in their journey, what‚Äôs one small change that made the biggest difference for you?

I‚Äôll start: slowing down while eating and stopping early was a game-changer. I used to eat until I felt full, but with Semaglutide, that feeling comes late, so I had to retrain myself to stop before that point. My digestion and comfort improved a lot.

1kc83t6,CobblerNo4221,Just restarted Semaglutide after 2 months off and 17 pound regain - Pics don‚Äôt lie- leg edema 1 week - 16 pound loss in SIX DAYS!,"Just restarted Semaglutide after 2 months off and 17 pound regain - Pics don‚Äôt lie- leg edema 1 week - 16 pounds loss in SIX DAYS!!!!!

Not kidding. Still fighting with UHC for coverage of W but got my hands on sema via other source & decided to take initial pics this time of my legs- especially the right one which has had severe edema issues since a spider bite near knee caused necrosis & whole body reaction. Also the calf with DVT in 2022 which led to Acute bilateral Extensive Pulmonary Emboli and permanent lung damage & Pulmonary Hypertension ( which leads to right ventricle failure)- but UHC says PH doesn't qualify me for coverage. Idiots. Anyway- wegovy Total weight loss Dec-Feb was right at 30 pounds.

Feb -March while sema was still in my system somewhat lost another 10 pounds-- then by April 10th doc appt I was 10 pound up. And in 2 weeks gained another 7- for a total post sema gain of 17 pounds in about 6 weeks.

Additionally - Other inflammation returned full force including arthritis, & neuropathy in both arms every single night awakening with pain and numbness multiple times a night.

I knew that back in Dec 2024 that the most immediately noticeable effect of wegovy was the reduction of my leg edema. I didn't expect it so I didn't take any measurements or pics. Last Friday my right lower leg felt like my skin was about to split open from the tightness from the edema. I took the SEMA dose and I decided to take measurements and pics this time.

I was NOT expecting what has happened with my edema over the last SIX days. Nor the scale. 16 pounds loss. 3 1/2 inches smaller at that one part of my leg where I have a scar so I made sure to measure in the same spot every time. That's just one spot of my leg I measured. My WHOLE legs are smaller- and feet and arms - Oh yeah- arms- I haven't had severe pain/ numbness/ neuropathy waking me up AT ALL for the last 4 nights.

This is my opinion. They accidentally created a medication that helps bodies heal chronic inflammation due to lymphatic system issues. They don't even understand how the lymphatic system works. They didn't mean to market something which would help people actually GET WELL. That kind of goes against their bottom line which needs us to be sick for them to profit.

They also didn't mean to create something that regulates the dopamine response in people with compulsive disorders such as substance abuse, alcoholism, smoking, AND Hoarding disorder.

They really didn't know what they made because mice don't smoke or drink etc...

Now the word is out and they can't shut down what is so obviously happening as ""side-effects"" so they are trying their best to limit access to glp-1 antagonists by making it cost prohibitive.",234,43,2025-05-01T18:29:26,Semaglutide,https://i.redd.it/8lqyskkk46ye1.jpeg,0.98,False,/r/Semaglutide/comments/1kc83t6/just_restarted_semaglutide_after_2_months_off_and/

1dz13jh,tacotow,How did you get your semaglutide prescription? ,"I‚Äôve reached my breaking point. Two years ago I lost weight and developed a good fitness routine and thought I would never go back to feeling overweight and depressed. And yet two years later, here I am. Again. On vacation and hating the way I look in all my pictures. I injured my knee, stopped the gym and walks were not enough, the weight came back. I‚Äôve flagged to my general doctor I want to lose weight again and in our last check-in and she recommended I get a meal prepped service like Factor. Which I did for the last couple of months but hasn‚Äôt made a difference weight wise. I also have binging tendencies. She also ordered my regular lab work and said : let‚Äôs see how those test come back and if needed we can explore other weight loss options. All my numbers came back normal (thankfully). But I do have high blood pressure and take medicine for that. 

Anyway, once I return from vacation my goal is to reprioritize my health and weight loss. Not sure if I should ask my MD for this medicine or if my insurance will cover. 

Questions for this community:
- did anyone get their medicine covered by Kaiser? 
- did your md prescribe it with just high blood pressure ?
- if you got it online, is there a service you recommend?
- anything else from your experience getting semaglutide that I can learn from?

I went with IVIM and was supposed to take 0.25mg (5 units) but that seemed wrong to my dad because he was used to my mom's high dose so he ended up giving me an injection of 2.5mg (50 units). Yes that's right... I took 10 TIMES what I should have. Here's my story of what happened in the following days...

DAY1-3: I woke up feeling like I had a reallyyy bad flu. Body aches, fatigue, chills, nausea. I couldn't eat anything, It was all I could do to just force myself to stay hydrated. I lived in bed and didn't move at all.

DAY4-7: these were the worst days because the nausea became unbearable and I spent most of my time with a pillow by the toilet because I vomited so much. I have this weird thing where I hate people hearing me puke, so I came up with a solution: for a white elephant gift exchange, I bought this little plastic chef you bring out when you make pasta and it screams the song ""that's amore"", so I decided to keep that with me. Whenever I had to puke, the sound of my vomiting and tears were drowned out by the plastic Italian man's song üé∂. For the rest of my life, I'll feel guilty for what I exposed this little chef to in the coming days.

DAY8-9: Felt MUCH better and mostly normal other than extreme stomach pain that I initially thought to be caused by 7 days of an empty stomach and several days of vomiting. A couple hours after I woke up, the 48 hour diarrhea began... If you are sensitive to graphic depictions of the bathroom, you can skip this paragraph. But I cannot emphasize enough, this was by FAR the most painful bathroom experience I've had in my life. My guts were screaming at me in German, and even though my stomach was still fairly empty, it felt like I was giving birth to Dwayne the rock Johnson. It's been rare, but I have cried while throwing up a couple times in my life, but this is the first time I cried on the toilet. The night of Day 9 will permanently burned into my mind because as I was sobbing on the toilet and praying to God, I pressed the button on the little Italian chef because I heard someone walk near my room, and I heard my dad burst into laughter. He later told me he came to check on me when he heard the sound of me crying paired with volcanic eruptions on the toilet and he said that he laughed because ""that's amore"" started playing at a volume not loud enough to drown out everything else, so instead he heard the song play in unison with the sounds of my tears and bowels.

Luckily the next day I was healed. Tomorrow will be one week since I started feeling normal again. Overall, pretty awful experience but at least I lost 9 pounds ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø. I plan on dosing correctly and trying again.

EDIT: I realize I make my dad seem awful here, but he actually did feel AWFUL. We have a great relationship and a terrible mistake was made. 

EDIT2: Like I said in the beginning, this post was getting too long so I removed a lot of it. I DID actually call 911 in the beginning and then decided to call my pharmacist and advice nurse before I had an ambulance come. They told me that the dose I took was still within prescribed range and due to my age, height, weight I would be okay. I ended up going to restore wellness to get a liquid IV as well.",158,80,2024-12-11T05:05:12,Semaglutide,https://www.reddit.com/r/Semaglutide/comments/1hbfoh9/my_semaglutide_horror_story/,0.89,True,/r/Semaglutide/comments/1hbfoh9/my_semaglutide_horror_story/

1k76e2y,letsgoyahoowoops,PSA: If you're on Ozempic or Mounjaro and weed feels flat or ‚Äúoff‚Äù‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs not in your head.,"So I‚Äôve been smoking regularly for years, mainly for emotional regulation, introspection, and that feeling of being really present or in awe. A few months into being on Ozempic (semaglutide) and later Mounjaro (tirzepatide), I noticed something really strange:

Weed still got me ‚Äúhigh,‚Äù but it was‚Ä¶ muted. No body buzz. No emotional waves. No music chills. Just kind of detached and numb, like my brain was watching the high from 10 feet away.

At first, I thought it was tolerance. Switched strains. Tried higher doses. Took t-breaks. Nothing helped.

Then I started digging into the science and what I found honestly made me angry:

GLP-1 drugs like Ozempic and Mounjaro can desensitize serotonin 5-HT2A receptors (the same ones psychedelics activate), which are critical for the emotional, awe-filled, ‚Äúdeep‚Äù part of the cannabis experience.

Even worse? Nobody talks about this. Not doctors. Not the drug companies. There are no warnings, no studies on cannabis interaction, and zero mention of how it can totally change your relationship with weed.

If you‚Äôre on one of these meds and weed doesn‚Äôt feel right anymore, you‚Äôre not crazy, this is a real neurochemical shift. And if you‚Äôre someone who uses weed for more than just a buzz (like managing mood or trauma), this can feel like a big loss.

Just wanted to put this out there for anyone else feeling gaslit or confused by the change. You‚Äôre not alone, and we need more people talking about it.

UPDATE (April 29, 2025):
After more digging (and personal testing), I‚Äôve realized Tirzepatide (Mounjaro) is likely a much bigger culprit than Ozempic when it comes to muting the effects of weed.

Tirzepatide doesn‚Äôt just hit GLP-1 receptors,  it also targets GIP receptors, which play a role in dopamine and reward signaling. Activating GIP receptors seems to further blunt the emotional and sensory impact of THC downstream in the brain, especially in key areas like the nucleus accumbens.

In plain English:
If you're on Mounjaro, weed can feel even flatter and more detached than it would on Ozempic alone, because it's dampening the brain circuits that THC normally lights up.

Still frustrated there‚Äôs no warning about this anywhere. Just wanted to keep everyone updated so you know you're not imagining it.",323,194,2025-04-25T04:48:49,Semaglutide,https://www.reddit.com/r/Semaglutide/comments/1k76e2y/psa_if_youre_on_ozempic_or_mounjaro_and_weed/,0.9,True,/r/Semaglutide/comments/1k76e2y/psa_if_youre_on_ozempic_or_mounjaro_and_weed/

I recently started and haven‚Äôt seen much of a difference, but I‚Äôve struggled a lot of with body dysmorphia and mental health after having children. My exhusband was abusive and part of that was always shaming me for the changes my body went through having three children. It was so bad at one point I couldn‚Äôt leave my house or look at myself in the mirror without hearing everything he said to me becoming who I seen back at me. 
I was put on ozempic by my PCP to help with weight management, my diabetes, and him and both my ob agreed it would help with my PCOS which I can say it has. But this journey is a personal one for me and I‚Äôve only opened up to my sister and mom about it because I feel its no one else‚Äôs business and I‚Äôve already struggled so much healing from being body shamed, I‚Äôm not opening that door for others to give me their input or throw judgement at me.

I told her the two subjects made no sense for her to bring me up in. How does someone giving you a sweater turn into saying howd you know my sister is on Ozempic. 
& now that I recall, I never even told my sister, she seen the box in my fridge and that‚Äôs how she found out. I only told my mom.

1i3dyij,quinfchris77,"OZEMPIC partly to blame for wine bar closure, owner says","Last year db revealed that a report by financial services company Moody‚Äôs Ratings indicated that by 2023 as many as 30 million Americans could be on a GLP-1 drug such as Ozempic.

The report suggested that the growing use of Ozempic could end up impacting the drinks trade, as those taking the drug report experiencing a decreased appetite for both food and alcohol.

One person exploring the relationship between Ozempic and alcohol consumption in detail is pharmacologist Elizabet Jerlhag at the University of Gothenburg, Sweden. Jerlhag has for several years been researching how GLP-1 drugs such as Ozempic reduce alcohol consumption in rats. In more than 12 published studies, Jerlhag found that taking the drugs significantly decreased the rats‚Äô consumption of alcohol.

1i2kdmg,quinfchris77,OZEMPIC IN THE NEW YORK TIMES,"Incredible newspaper article from the The New York Times, about how Ozempic could crush the junk food industry.

It tells us how #semaglutide (#Wegovy, #Ozempic, #Zepbound, Novo Nordisk), a #GLP-1 agonist, today approved to treat type 2 #diabetes and #obesity, is changing food habits in people under medication.
By mimicking the satiety hormon GLP-1, that slows digestion and signals fullness to the brain, this drug or similars seem to prevent people from 1/ overconsuming food and 2/eating ultraprocessed food, by modifying their palate. GLP-1 users are more interesting in healthier low-calory diets, based on fruits, vegetables, ... ""Wegovy destroyed my taste buds [...] And I love it, "" a Redditor wrote on a support group.
Around 7 millions of American people are currently under medication with a GLP-1 analog and the forecasts announce up to 24 million by 2035, as more than 100 million American adults are obese to date.
Side note, the brain effects of these drugs may go beyond reducing food addiction, as they appear ""to make cocaine, alcohol and cigarettes more resistible.""",254,90,2025-01-16T13:52:51,Semaglutide,https://www.reddit.com/r/Semaglutide/comments/1i2kdmg/ozempic_in_the_new_york_times/,0.93,True,/r/Semaglutide/comments/1i2kdmg/ozempic_in_the_new_york_times/
1o2ol2t,letsgoyahoowoops,I keep losing weight on Ozempic plus Buspirone and I am not sure what is going on,"Hey everyone. I wanted to share what has been happening to me because I am a little confused and kind of amazed at the same time.

So I have been on Ozempic for about four months now for insulin resistance and weight management. The results have been pretty typical at first like slow and steady weight loss, less hunger, the usual nausea during the first few weeks. Everything felt pretty normal.

Then my doctor added Buspirone about six weeks ago for anxiety. It has helped a lot with the mental side of things, but ever since starting it, my appetite has basically disappeared. Like, completely gone some days.

I know Ozempic already makes you feel full faster, but this feels next level. I will make a meal, take a few bites, and I am done. Even the smell of food sometimes feels like enough. It is kind of wild.

I have lost around nine pounds since adding Buspirone, which is way faster than before. I have not been trying to eat less, but it just happens naturally because I do not want food. I am not nauseous, just completely uninterested in eating.

I am wondering if anyone else here has had this combo and noticed the same thing. Is it possible the Buspirone is making the Ozempic effects stronger? Or is this just random timing and my body finally responding more to the Ozempic?

Either way I am keeping an eye on it because I do not want to lose too much too fast. My doctor said to track calories and make sure I am getting enough protein and hydration.

Would love to hear if anyone else is on both and what your experience has been like.

The wife started on Ozempic prescribed for weight loss last year by her doctor and it has been life changing for her.  She isn't hungry all the time anymore; her mood/psyche isn't completely controlled by food.  She has struggled with her weight for a decade, she has trouble excersizing due to multiple medical issues / injuries.  This drug has been life changing for her.

Her company's insurance provider just sent her a letter saying they will not pay for this drug anymore for weight loss, and she is now unable to get it through them starting in march.  The wife is devastated.  We do not have the money to afford $1000+/month.

What are our options here?  Go back to her primary and plead for another option?  Go file an appeal with her insurance provider?  Does anyone have any experience with working around this type of thing?  Is Wegovy easier to get for weight loss?  Alternatively source?  Are there doctors who will bend the rules and prescribe it like all the doctors prescribing marijuana for the glaucoma no one has?

1nnjo0u,Feisty_Profession612,My body hates 1mg Ozempic (but 0.5 did nothing),"I‚Äôve been on Ozempic for a bit now and I can‚Äôt really figure out if what I‚Äôm going through is normal. On 0.5 mg literally nothing happened. No side effects, no appetite changes, just felt like I was wasting time.

Then I went up to 1 mg. First shot: fine, just some gross sulfur burps. Second shot: same. Third shot: it started hitting harder, cramps, food just sitting in my stomach for hours. Fourth shot: complete nightmare. Within 24 hours I had waves of extreme stomach cramps and ended up throwing up more then ever before. I‚Äôm not exaggerating when I say the smell literally reeked of death.

Since then it‚Äôs been all over the place. Some days I can manage with light stuff like rice cakes, soup, applesauce. The next day I eat something more normal and my stomach turns on me again and I‚Äôm either nauseous or running to the bathroom. No pattern I can trust.

What‚Äôs messing with me the most is the hunger cycle. First 4 days after the shot I don‚Äôt care about food at all. Day 5 I start feeling a bit more hungry. By day 6 and 7 it‚Äôs like the urge is completely back, like the shot never happened. Then I inject again and repeat the whole thing.

I was on Saxenda for over a year and never had this, so it feels strange that Ozempic is hitting me this way. 0.5 mg feels useless, 1 mg feels too much, and I‚Äôm stuck between. I‚Äôve even thought about doing 1 mg every 10 days instead of weekly to see if that helps.

Right now I‚Äôm eating small and light, drinking ORS when I feel drained, but it‚Äôs frustrating not knowing if this is just an adjustment phase or if this is how it‚Äôs going to be for me.

Has anyone else had this? Like nothing at 0.5, total chaos at 1 mg, and appetite suppression that only lasts for half the week? Did it ever settle down or did you have to change dosing?

TL;DR: 0.5 mg did nothing, 1 mg wrecked me, appetite comes back by day 6‚Äì7.

I‚Äôve been on Ozempic now for 18 months, starting at 355lbs and as of today I‚Äôm currently 239.8lbs, and I nearly cried seeing the scale under 240. I‚Äôve been dealing with some other issues as of late, both mentally and physically, however I was able to take a short leave from work to get all that in order. In the last few months I‚Äôve also gotten a personal trainer and I‚Äôm excited seeing my body getting stronger. I haven‚Äôt been this weight in over 10 years. 

I eventually want to get to 90kg , so just at about  198lbs. I‚Äôm not sure what I‚Äôll want at that point. I‚Äôm a tall woman (5‚Äô11‚Äù) and have a more muscular frame so I think I‚Äôd be content at about 175lbs for maintenance. But it's wild, l've lost over 10 inches from my hips (which was really mainly belly) and about 10 inches from my waist. It may be more though as I forgot to measure at my heaviest and only measured when I was already down 25lbs.

I had a bit of a stall from Oct 2023 to April 2024 at about 270 but I‚Äôve been focusing on moving more. Out of the 115lbs lost, 50 were in the last year but 21 were in the last 3 months. Those 3 months include 2 months of weight training. I included those stats. 

As an aside, I‚Äôve been using MyFitnessPal since 2012 so I‚Äôve also included the weight gain over the 12 years. ",415,25,2024-10-05T11:40:20,Semaglutide,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1fwjwxx,1.0,False,/r/Semaglutide/comments/1fwjwxx/18_months_on_ozempic_115lbs_down/
1kxt77h,wildinthemembrane,Is it safe to take Ozempic while actively bulimic?,"I‚Äôve been bulimic for 15 years. Usually I purge once a day, but sometimes it‚Äôs more like 3 or more times. Occasionally I can go 3 or 4 days without purging, but that‚Äôs rare. Right now, it‚Äôs around 2 to 3 times a week.

My doctor knows about my history and I remind him every time we talk. He still decided to put me on Ozempic and I‚Äôm currently taking 0.25 mg. (I‚Äôm medically obese on the BMI chart). He mentioned that it won‚Äôt help with dopamine-driven eating like emotional binges, which I understand. I tried to tell him that Vyvanse was the only thing that ever worked for me. While I was on Vyvanse for 30 days, I didn‚Äôt binge or purge once and I had zero urges. It was the only time I‚Äôve felt actual control.

I have a formal ADHD diagnosis from a psychiatrist I‚Äôve seen three times. Despite this, my current doctor keeps saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not buying it‚Äù and refuses to prescribe Vyvanse. I‚Äôm frustrated, but I‚Äôm trying to work with what I‚Äôve got.

So here‚Äôs my question. Is it actually safe to continue taking Ozempic while I‚Äôm still purging a few times a week? I‚Äôve searched for info but most of it is vague or doesn‚Äôt address active bulimia.

1nbo2fl,Queasy_Explorer_9361,"Ozempic Hunger rebound, maintanance, Set point, facial changes","Hey everyone,

I‚Äôve been using Ozempic mainly as part of my bodybuilding approach during a diet phase. I lost about 15 kg (around 33 lbs), got down to a normal weight, and managed to preserve my muscle mass. The side effects were limited to occasional mild constipation, so overall I was really, really satisfied.

Now I‚Äôm wondering: for those of you who have used Ozempic and then stopped it, did you experience a strong return of hunger and something like a yo-yo effect? Or did you feel more like you had established a new setpoint and were able to maintain your weight?

Another thing I‚Äôd like to ask about: I‚Äôve noticed some facial changes ‚Äì my face looks a bit sunken, I have dark circles under my eyes, and my eyes appear slightly hollow. Has anyone else experienced this, and did it improve or go away over time?

I did some looking and tried to gather some more recent stuff on how people are thinking about ""Ozempic face"", and it looks like most of the fear has sort of died down:

[https://glp1.guide/content/reminder-ozempic-face-isnt-real](https://glp1.guide/content/reminder-ozempic-face-isnt-real)

There are still some articles like this though which still do some fearmongering:

[https://www.allure.com/story/ozempics-effects-on-skin](https://www.allure.com/story/ozempics-effects-on-skin)

What makes it really annoying to try and find definitive information about this is that there just \*isn't\* much else to compare GLP1s to, in order to figure out if there's any other statistically significant effect of using GLP1s to lose weight and whether the skin acts differently.

For now, outside of anecdata (albeit from experts/plastic surgeons), the effects of this seems to just be rapid weight loss (like what would happen if you lost weight any other way).

  
**As far as what someone can actually do about this -- has anyone explored staying on a low dose for longer? It's the simple common sense solution, but I don't see people talk about it a lot.**

1lfezm4,rmt88,5 Years In...,"I am 5 years into my journey (my last post was about 2 years ago when I was getting ready for skin removal surgery). 

My stats.... started around 260/270lbs, I am currently around 130-135lbs, 5'3"", late 30's. I am 2 years post skin removal surgery at this point (extended abdominal plasty, breast reduction and lift) and I am about 5-10 pounds less than when I had that surgery.

I still take this medication every week (although I have switched to Zepbound in the last 6 months) and plan to continue this medication for the rest of my life. I see a lot of people posting on here about starting their journey and it can be a little discouraging, especially in the beginning when you are dealing with side effects, or when you hit a plateau. Just know to keeping pushing through (unless your side effects impact your daily life, then I would definitely recommend reaching out to your doctor). 

I am more than happy to answer any questions you might have. I am probably one of the early adopters of this medication (I like to say I had Ozempic face before it was cool to have Ozempic face) and in the beginning I was hesitant to tell anyone I was on this med. Over the last few years I have come to the conclusion I shouldn't be embarrassed. There is nothing to be embarrassed about and I should be proud of the hard work I put in during my journey (the meds help, yes... but you still have to do the work).

My partner opened up about starting on Ozempic, I want to be the BEST support for him. But I also figure that Ozempic is a very personal thing. We've spoken and he says he's excited. I've already told him I am here to support him. Be as part of the change as much as I can.

But I'd also want to know from people who have been on Ozempic for a while as to how does this feel from a ""my partner"" perspective. Is it better I back off and not ask? or is it better to cheer every minimal thing?

Someone told me there might be psychological aspects to keep into account. But I'm not sure what that ever meant, albeit he's on the first week right now and is a bit snappy and moody. I also read that there might be libido changes and I'm okay with that as long as Ozempic is the way towards what he wants. Just, I'm not sure who to listen so I'd figure I might as well just ask the pros.

What should I expect?

1i3o2e9,FormerlyObeseJ,33 Must-Know Tips for Ozempic/Wegovy Beginners,"Here are the top tips distilled from hundreds of posts into one straightforward list.

1. Take ""before"" pictures ‚Äì you'll regret not having them later.
2. Record all your body measurements before starting ‚Äì the tape measure often shows progress when the scale doesn't.
3. Don't expect overnight results, some people don't see changes until month 3.
4. Choose your injection day wisely ‚Äì ideally before your days off.
5. Stay at each dose for a minimum of 4 weeks to minimize side effects.
6. Your ideal dose is the lowest one that works for you - higher doses don't necessarily mean better results.
7. Rotate where you inject: your tummy,¬†thighs, upper arms.
8. Don't skip meals, even when not hungry to maintain stable blood sugar.
9. Prioritize protein in every meal.
10. Focus on getting enough fiber daily, target 25-35g each day.
11. Plan your meals in advance.
12. Track your calories consistently using a reliable app.
13. Drink more water than you think you need ‚Äì dehydration worsens side effects.
14. Jazz up your water with flavoring or find a bottle you love ‚Äì whatever helps you drink more.
15. Avoid high-fat and fried foods ‚Äì they can trigger nausea.
16. Stay away from carbonated beverages.
17. Avoid acidic foods and drinks that might trigger reflux.
18. Wait 3 hours after eating before lying down.
19. Rate your fullness after meals - it feels different now.
20. Start a simple walking routine ‚Äì even a few minutes daily helps.
21. Track your steps and gradually increase them.
22. Keep protein shakes handy for low-appetite days.
23. Have ginger chews available for nausea.
24. Keep Gas-X on hand for digestive discomfort.
25. Keep both Miralax and Imodium on hand for potential bowel issues.
26. Monitor your bowel movements, anything beyond 3 days without one requires action.
27. Add hair vitamins or collagen protein powder if you notice thinning hair.
28. Choose simple, whole foods over complex, heavily sauced meals.
29. Create a daily movement ritual by parking in the farthest spot and taking stairs whenever possible.
30. Build a support system ‚Äì be selective about who you share your journey with.
31. Keep realistic expectations - sustainable loss is better than quick fixes.
32. Don't compare your experience to others - everyone's body responds differently.
33. Remember: Ozempic is a tool to help you make better choices, not a miracle solution.

1o100lx,Relevant-Position-57,Ozempic vs Wegovy,"I was on a med last year and lost 30lbs but it was out of pocket. I finally got insurance to cover Zepbound which I thought would be great and faster results. After 5 shots I ended up with what felt like an allergic reaction with severe effects - my first ever panic attack, heart palpitations, high blood pressure and was dizzy for a month straight - I couldn‚Äôt drive. I had 4 ER visits and all tests came back ‚Äúfine.‚Äù They said it was anxiety which I‚Äôve never experienced prior. I didn‚Äôt correlate everything to Zepbound because I was fine all last year on the other . I took about 2-3 months off after that and hoped to try Ozempic vs Wegovy as I thought Ozempic might be closer to what I took last year and from what I‚Äôve read, it affects heart rate the least out of all the meds. I have has ZERO side effects, thank goodness! BUT I haven‚Äôt lost ANY weight! I‚Äôm due for my 12th shot this week and last week was my first dose of 1mg. I made sure to titer up slowly to avoid any negative side effects given Zepbound disrupted my life so severely and that dose starts so much higher at 2.5mg right away. So I guess I explain all of this to say, since I haven‚Äôt lost anything on ozempic(but I read 1-2mg is the therapeutic dose) ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äîso is there any chance Wegovy would help me if I switched or do you think I still wouldn‚Äôt see any weight loss since it‚Äôs so similar to ozempic?

1kuh9iz,wildinthemembrane,Day 4 on Ozempic and the binging is out of control‚Ä¶ help?,"I‚Äôm on my 4th day of 0.25mg Ozempic and I‚Äôm honestly freaking out. I haven‚Äôt craved sugar in over six months. I got through Easter, birthdays, dinners out, all of it without any issues. I‚Äôve been eating really healthy and sticking to my goals for a long time.

Now, since starting Ozempic, the binging is out of control. Last night I ate a huge bag of Skittles in 10 minutes. I even binged on a whole bag of sugar-free cough drops, which was a terrible idea. I know people will say ‚Äújust don‚Äôt buy it,‚Äù and that makes sense in theory, but the cravings feel completely overwhelming. It honestly feels similar to being on an edible and getting the munchies. The hunger and urge to eat won‚Äôt stop.

I‚Äôm eating a minimum of 100 grams of protein a day. My meals usually include eggs, cottage cheese, chicken or steak, vegetables, and oatmeal. I also take hair gummies, magnesium bisglycinate, zinc, a multivitamin, vitamin B12, and fiber gummies every single day. I add collagen powder to my coffee once a day too. I feel like I‚Äôm doing everything right.

Today alone I‚Äôm already 600 calories over my daily limit of 1300, which I was able to stick to easily before Ozempic. I feel starving and totally out of control. Is this normal at the beginning? Does it eventually settle down? I would really appreciate any advice or personal experiences. I was prescribed ozempic due to being overweight but also as a means to treat my BED and bulimia. So far, the binging is definitely just triggering me and I feel like I might slip back into my bulimia if I can‚Äôt get it under control.

1n0mfrn,Objective-Ad-3694,"Should I go from 0.25 to 0.5mg Ozempic as prescribed, or stay at 0.25? The low dose is working for food noise (but not weight loss)","Hi all, first time posting on this forum. I started Ozempic three weeks ago on a 0.25 dose and got some pretty instant results in terms of my physiology. Almost as soon as my first dose, I noticed some issues I have been struggling with decreasing. Previously, If I didn't eat on time or enough I got terrible stomach cramps. If I skipped a meal I got strong headaches. If I ate enough to be satisfied, I'd be extremely drowsy after the meal, particularly lunch time. All of this seems to have disappeared overnight along with the 'food noise' many posts mention on here. 

I have had some nausea, and that combined with the fact that it seems to be 'working', makes me wonder if I shouldn't stick where I am on 0.25 rather than moving up to 0.5 the week after next.

On the other hand, I had an instant appetite decrease and energy uptick. I have been monitoring CiCo and have been fairly consistently in a deficit of around 4-500 kCal per day. The scale has not moved an iota, which I am a bit surprised about considering my high levels of activity (between 10-15,000 steps per day) and Cal deficit. Particularly as the nausea almost prevented me eating for two days - is it normal not to see any difference at all, and is moving up to 0.5 likely to help? Thanks all.

>*The long-term success rate for natural dieting is effectively 0%. It is ridiculous to imagine that I would be the lone exception. I'm genetically destined for obesity unless I take medicine. Natural appetites are irresistible, and everyone who thinks they are thin because of moral virtue is an arrogant fool.*

1o19w4d,lifeafterw4rds,Wegovy made my quality of life worse,"-Disclaimer-

Throwaway account for medical privacy as my main has identifying information.

I wanted to share my experiences of being on Wegovy for 5.5-6 months because as far as I‚Äôve been able to see, the consequences I experienced appear to be an outlier compared to all the success stories. I hope no one takes this as me telling anyone how they should or shouldn‚Äôt feel about the medication - this is purely my time on the drug and how it impacted me negatively, and you can take this anecdote as you wish.

‚Äî-

The first month or so I felt all the hallmarks of the side effects that come with weaning yourself onto the medication. A loss in appetite, severe heartburn and nausea, intense body weakness. My practitioner assured me that while my reactions seemed a little more intense than most, it wasn‚Äôt anything to worry about and would soon subside so long as I was getting in enough water and protein.

I was diligent about those two factors but exercise did not come to me easily, every day I felt bed ridden and nauseous, standing up made me feel lightheaded, all smells made me gag. For a moment I considered if I was pregnant because it sounded a lot like morning sickness, but I wasn‚Äôt.

Every monthly check in with my professional was a back and forth of me saying ‚ÄúI feel terrible, the weight is barely moving, it‚Äôs hard to sleep with how much discomfort I‚Äôm in.‚Äù And every time I would be told I obviously wasn‚Äôt doing something right because it‚Äôs month 3 and I‚Äôm still nauseous and still only slightly lighter than when I first started. The worst part was at month 3-4 I stopped feeling appetite loss. This didn‚Äôt mean I was binge eating or anything, portions remained controlled and very balanced, but there wasn‚Äôt that obvious curb in my appetite anymore and the lack of exercise wasn‚Äôt helping my cause. At this point I started questioning why I was even on this drug if it wasn‚Äôt doing the one thing it was put on the market to do.

As weeks and months of incrementally going up in dosage and the lethargy not subsiding continued, my mental health rapidly deteriorated. I have an ongoing history of depression and anxiety, and for the first time in several years, when I passed 1mg I started having suicidal thoughts. 
These were intrusive thoughts, not linked to any changing life events as far as I can self evaluate (my life has been fairly stable and boring this year), I‚Äôm very familiar with how my brain works and this felt like the same hormonal/chemical imbalances that put me into hospital years earlier for my mental wellbeing. This wasn‚Äôt an emotional reaction to something, this was a shift in my cognition and thought processes.

I was told to increase my antidepressants and stay on course with the wegovy. Lethargy remained, nausea remained, the declining mental health remained. Moderate levels of Pilates was all I could manage to do in terms of exercise and I would actively have to take it as slowly as I could to not vomit, which was clearly not helping my mental state nor lowering the number on the scales.

At the end of month six, having only lost 5kilos since starting and feeling the worst I had felt in my life, my practitioner told me maybe the dosage had to go up to 2.5mg, and with that comes a huge increase in the cost per dispensing. It no longer seemed worth it to me. I withdrew from the program that week.

I‚Äôm now convinced the lethargy, depression, and chronic nausea was the wegovy - I couldn‚Äôt increase my exercise without being in total misery, I couldn‚Äôt sleep without a bucket next to my bed, I had to spend double on my antidepressant dosage to cover the anxiety I felt. And within weeks of quitting wegovy, all of those symptoms were gone.

Completely gone!

I was sleeping like a baby, my mood was markedly lighter, it was like night and day. The nausea wasn‚Äôt smothering me anymore and I was actually able to meaningfully exercise. Within the first month of quitting wegovy I have lost a kilo and a half - the fastest weight loss I had ever experienced since starting the treatment. I have successfully lowered my antidepressant dosage back to what it was before wegovy, with no ramifications or relapses in my mental health.

The best thing I did for myself this year was stop taking Wegovy. 

I‚Äôm not a doctor and I can‚Äôt speak to anyone else‚Äôs reactions to the drug, but for me, it‚Äôs hard not to look back on how terrible I felt constantly and view the whole experiment as a waste of time. I‚Äôm really proud of everyone in here who has made the most of it and come out the other end better for it, and I SO wish that could‚Äôve been the way it was for me. I‚Äôm taking this as a learning opportunity, to listen to my body and not get too caught up in the ‚Äúsunk cost fallacy‚Äù of it all. 

To anyone here who is toughing it out several months in and not experiencing any positives, I hope you read my post and find some hope and strength to evaluate all of your options, because I came off wegovy and feel so so much better for it.",61,75,2025-10-08T18:32:57,Semaglutide,https://www.reddit.com/r/Semaglutide/comments/1o19w4d/wegovy_made_my_quality_of_life_worse/,0.79,True,/r/Semaglutide/comments/1o19w4d/wegovy_made_my_quality_of_life_worse/
1eqcbaf,wegovywoman,IT‚ÄôS MY ONE YEAR ANNIVERSARY ON WEGOVY! (-80),"SW: 222.2
CW: 140.3

A year ago, I started my Wegovy journey and scoured pretty much every single post on this sub at the time. I was hoping one day, I‚Äôd be able to post my story. And I‚Äôm so f^#%ing honored I get to do that today. 

Not exaggerating when I say this medicine has saved my life. I was prescribed it after multiple failed efforts to battle my binge eating disorder. I had lived with BED for so long that food eventually became my only source of comfort. And it started to be very obvious once my metabolism slowed down during my last 2 years of college. Binging was my self harm, but it was also the only way I felt comforted. A toxic cycle that was seemingly impossible to break. 

In August of last year, during a routine blood test, my doctor sounded the alarm about a number of concerning results. I was then referred to an oncologist who essentially told me I needed to get help, or I‚Äôd continue to cause irreversible damage to my body. It was the first time in my life that I put my hands up and surrendered to my binge eating disorder and food addiction. It was no longer a matter of the classic, unhelpful advice of ~just stop eating and move more~ but rather a deep psychological addiction that needed medical intervention.

It‚Äôs been a year since I binged and I‚Äôve lost 80 pounds. There‚Äôs still a significant amount of work to do mentally and physically, but as I write this today, I accomplished something that I‚Äôve been battling with for my entire existence. And I‚Äôm so f^#%ing proud of myself. Nothing can take this away from me. 

Comments are open! Ask me anything. I will say that I did a few things unconventionally - for example - not meeting protein goals because I physically couldn‚Äôt do it. Also, I have emetophobia and was a little too cautious at times. In 1 year, I only got sick once. And I think it was because my blood sugar was low‚Ä¶ forgot to eat/drink. Anyway‚Ä¶ whatcha got?

1ixyzm9,Milkshaketurtle79,Insurance won't cover wegovy anymore after I've lost 140 pounds. I'm at a loss on what to do.,"This drug has genuinely changed my life. I originally had Bariatric surgery and lost a good amount of weight. I gained a lot of it back. My doctor put me on wegovy, and it changed my life. It gave me self control. I've been able to lose almost 140 pounds since my heaviest and I was even starting to lose more. I used to be 333lbs, and now I'm at 193. I used to not be able to walk around the block without getting winded. Now, the furthest I've walked was 14 miles in one day (it was absolutely NOT fun, but I survived it). It's given me a second chance at life.  

I recently changed insurance due to work. I went to refill my prescription, and learned my insurance doesn't cover it (or any other weight loss meds). I'm just devastated, honestly. I don't want to go back to living like that. My joints were in constant pain, I hated myself, I couldn't wear anything I wanted. I'm so fucking terrified of gaining the weight back. I know that you have to learn healthier habits for weight loss and that I can't just use drugs as a crutch. But I'm eating exactly what I did on wegovy and I'm fucking starving all the time. Has anybody been through this? Did you find anything else that helped? I've been so upset and I don't know what to do or who to talk to. I feel like these years and years of work and sacrifice have all been for nothing.

But slimming down comes with a price, albeit one that the 39-year-old Chicago resident said she‚Äôs more than willing to pay. Specifically, Allen has had to buy new clothes ‚Äî some $5,000 worth ‚Äî to fit her trimmer frame. Plus, there‚Äôs a psychological component to her recent fashion fervor.
‚ÄúI look better, so I want to reward my body,‚Äù Allen told MarketWatch.
And Allen isn‚Äôt the only GLP-1 user shifting her spending habits. Many people on these weight-loss drugs ‚Äî which include Ozempic, Wegovy, Zepbound and Mounjaro ‚Äî report that they‚Äôre shelling out more for clothes and a variety of other goods and services to fit their changing lifestyles. At the same time, some also say their grocery and dining-out budgets have been slashed, a natural result of taking a medication that can significantly curb one‚Äôs appetite.¬†
The growing impact of GLP-1 drugs on the American economy could be as significant as the changes being wrought by the artificial-intelligence boom, according to Prashant Agrawal, the founder and chief executive of Impact Analytics, a software-as-a-service company. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going to be a big shift,‚Äù he said.¬†

I'm currently taking 0.25mg but I noticed something not nice happening: most of my appetite was suppressed thanks to ADHD medication (im on 40mg ritalin) but since I started taking Wegovy, my appetite is a bottomless pit. I need to eat 2x more than usual to feel slightly sated and all my binge eating episodes are back after being gone with ritalin.... So after just 2 weeks on Wegovy, I actually gained 2kgs (\~4.5lbs). 

Is this a normal thing? I'm dreading the medication will not work on me after experiencing this...   
Other than that, I felt no side effects at all, absolutely none, except maybe that it makes me irritated/short fused.

For the record: I (40f) am 103kgs (227lbs). I usually eat around 1300 calories a day with various nutrient sources, I'm caution about sugar and fat, I walk a lot (2 hours a day) and I have a little desk cycle for when I work to stay active. 

I also have PCOS and have been struggling with my weight all my life despite the fact that I didn't even eat that bad aside from the binges. I had a gastric band, tried metformin, drastic diets, nothing worked. All the doctors I went to told me I ""do not eat enough to weight that much"" so I'm terrified this drug won't work either. 

Any thoughts??",3,10,2025-10-24T22:17:56,Semaglutide,https://www.reddit.com/r/Semaglutide/comments/1of2vcc/2_weeks_on_wegovy_and_my_hunger_has_never_been/,0.72,True,/r/Semaglutide/comments/1of2vcc/2_weeks_on_wegovy_and_my_hunger_has_never_been/

She has a hard time eating or drinking anything and gets nauseous if she tries to eat more. Yesterday all she had to eat was 3 eggs, and couldn't stomach anything else.

Struggled with my weight and dieting my whole life, finally decided to make big changes now that I turned 30. Wegovy has been a complete game changer!!!

Started by seeing a nutritionist last year. Jan 12, 2025 started 0.25mg wegovy with immediate results. Feb 2025 upped to 0.5mg wegovy. Mar 2025 went up to 1mg wegovy, and still on this dose although the food noise is starting to come back. Doc says to maintain with 1mg for a bit and then start weening myself off. 

My progress is 100% due to diet; I made no exercise changes. Once I got to 1mg I started getting sick from anything unhealthy. I was also very tired so I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to exercise much. Now the nausea and exhaustion are gone and I find my stomach, arms and legs have some loose skin, so I‚Äôm switching my focus to exercise. 

Interesting things I noticed during this process:
- Mothers were the first to notice changes! My grandma noticed when I was only 7 lbs down. Moms I work with commented at 15 lbs down. Men didn‚Äôt comment until I was 40 lbs down, and it was men who also struggle with their weight first, then the fitness bros that were proud of me.
- Growing up, all the early 2000s movies had skinny girls that thought they were fat. As a result, they always told us not to weigh ourselves every day, that we‚Äôll develop an eating disorder and end up in the hospital. But this was the opposite advice of what I needed‚Ä¶I realized I always think I look great and the same even as I‚Äôm gaining too much weight for my frame. I guess I have the opposite of body dysmorphia? And I mentally explain away increasing sizes, blaming style changes or needing more room for my boobs. So I learned I need to weigh myself daily so I can peg myself to reality. Does anyone else feel like this??
- My feet went down a half size, and I had to shorten my necklace and watch chains. Didn‚Äôt expect that!
- It‚Äôs so much easier to shop now. It makes me sad that clothing companies don‚Äôt make bigger size clothing in the flattering fits for curvy girls. Everyone should be able to buy clothes that fit right. The exception is bras, they‚Äôre actually harder to find in my new size! 
- Wegovy isn‚Äôt cheap, but buying a whole new wardrobe was more expensive!!! Don‚Äôt skip including this in your budget",1678,117,2025-08-16T22:23:49,Semaglutide,https://i.redd.it/4rthtt14wejf1.jpeg,0.99,False,/r/Semaglutide/comments/1ms0tsp/reached_gw_71lbs_in_7_months_so_thankful_for_sema/

I understand that it lessens your appetite.  Does this mean you won't be able to enjoy the occasional feast, like Thanksgiving?  I mean even if one were trying to lose weight it's still ok to eat a lot every now and then.

One more thing, and I'm begging you not to judge or lecture me for thie or tell me how to change it: If I don't eat any produce is it possible to do Wegovy?

13f4yd7,Professional_Sound86,Extreme Hair loss on Wegovy! Has anyone managed to reverse and stop ongoing hair loss completely while still being on Wegovy?,"I was on Wegovy for 3 months and started my first dose in the beginning of February (stopped taking wegovy a month ago.) And since starting, I‚Äôve been experiencing more hair loss. First I didn‚Äôt think much of it however every time I washed my hair I lost even more hair. Since March I got concerned about my hair loss situation but still didn‚Äôt think of stopping wegovy. However the hair loss has got to the extreme point that when I would brush my hair (even a small part of my hair), my hair brush would get full of hair (on non- hair washing days) and it‚Äôs not bearable anymore. And so far I‚Äôve lost 7-8 pounds which isn‚Äôt a rapid weight loss at all. And Ive been taking iron, vitamin D and B12, Biotin, Collagen, Protein powder, and fiber before and since starting wegovy and eating mostly healthy. So I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs the GLP-1 hormone or other ingredients in wegovy but I know that it‚Äôs wegovy and not the ‚Äúrapid weight loss‚Äù. 

So I decided to stop taking it at least for now but still unsure of the decision because it was helping me and I really liked the medicine except the hair loss. And I‚Äôd like to know if anyone who has experienced severe hair loss on wegovy has managed to stop or reverse the hair loss COMPLETELY while still being on Wegovy? And if so what did you do or change or add to your routine?

I've never had a romantic partner because of how I look. i don't even have any friends now. i just want to look normal and healthy and be able to go home and be done with this part of my life. now i don't know what to do because i feel the extreme hunger is going to come back, I'll get even more depressed and start binging & purging again.

w7ro9j,TAKES_ENEMY,Split Dose for Wegovy,"Haven't seen a lot on how exactly to pull this off, but here's how I was able to split the wegovy 2.4 mg dose down to 1mg. 

Buy a small syringe with small needle(needs to be at least 1 ml.  Take plunger out of of syringe and place on table standing up so the rubber part doesn't touch anything.   Place the Wegovy pen over the opening of the syringe and press down as you would on your skin.   The semaglutide shoots out into the syringe all at once.    replace the plunger in the syringe but don't push it all the way in.   you need to turn it over so the liquid falls down in contact with rubber plunger.   Then flick it a bunch with your finger to get any other liquids down.   depress the plunger, aiming the needle upwards until the liquid reaches the needle.    

&#x200B;

The syringe I used has a mark for every .1 ml.    

The total injection for 2.4 mg is 0.75 ml.     

1mg/2.4mg =    .41666 = percentage of total volume needed to dose at 1 mg.   total volume is .75 ml although you may lose some in the transfer process.  Guess what? no problem, you didn't need it all anyway.   

.41666\*.75ml = about .3 ml which is what you need to inject if you want 1 mg.   If you want a different amount, you can change the math.   bottom line is .1 ml is about equal to .333 mg.",62,157,2022-07-25T20:51:46,Semaglutide,https://www.reddit.com/r/Semaglutide/comments/w7ro9j/split_dose_for_wegovy/,0.96,True,/r/Semaglutide/comments/w7ro9j/split_dose_for_wegovy/

After, all I had left were 14mg boxes and in my experience so far 7mg was already making me eat very little with some side effects so I felt I wasn‚Äôt ready for 14 yet. I researched a little on this subreddit and so far many people had little to no issues splitting their pills in half even though the box advised not to. I also spoke with a pharmacist that said it should be safe to cut in half so I figure it would be fine. The first two days I ate the half pills I experienced major stomach issues (diarrhea) after every meal with bad stomach pains in the morning.  
Since then I stopped taking rybelsus all together yet I‚Äôm still experiencing symptoms (after 3 weeks of not taking rybelsus). Even though it was for only 20+ days, I no longer eat or drink alcohol the same as I used to. I have a weaker stomach nowadays and I‚Äôm still experiencing those same stomach issues usually after dinner (not everyday).

- SW 222 lbs | CW 212 lbs | GW 150 lbs

Just started taking Rybelsus 3mg three weeks ago and wanted to document my experience here ‚Äî hope you find it useful! 

I was recently diagnosed with Hashimoto‚Äôs and have been on thyroid medication for over half a decade now. Tried mindful eating, intermittent fasting, keto, paleo, customised meal plans, meal replacements, rigorous diet regimes and so on but couldn‚Äôt stay consistent as I wasn‚Äôt seeing any results. Even if I ate moderate portions during the day, I ended up binge-eating on some nights to cope with being and feeling obese. I also found comfort in food due to other problems in my personal life. 

Being educated about Rybelsus by my doctor recently was life-changing. She started me on the lowest dose (3mg) 20 days ago. Rybelsus was the only option given to me as injectables haven‚Äôt been approved for use yet in my country.

I have lost exactly 10 pounds so far ‚Äî while most of it could be water weight, seeing a difference on the scale, no matter how small, has been very rewarding. I am still dealing with nausea, indigestion, bloating, heartburn and perhaps a teeny-tiny case of constipation but I feel more motivated than ever.

As my appetite has gone down, my portion sizes (although quite moderate to begin with) have also decreased and nighttime binging has come to a definite end. I haven‚Äôt been craving sugar as much anymore. Eating fast food gives me heartburn so I tend to stay away. 

I recently even bought a beautiful outfit in a smaller size to keep track of my progress! Planning to return to the gym soon for some light exercise in order to prevent major muscle loss.

But in the third month on 14mg the side effects were truly awful and wouldn‚Äôt seem to clear. When I contacted my doctors they advised I move back down to 7mg and that‚Äôs what I‚Äôve been on since (with no issues).

The 7mg don‚Äôt seem particularly effective now as I‚Äôm feeling hungry and eating slightly more again. I‚Äôm now debating going back up to 14mg.

1o2swqm,Automatic-Ebb-9248,My weight-loss Journey on Semaglutide/Rybelsus,"Hi all,

I have posted this on #Rybelsuspill subreddit as well . I am posting this here to reach a wider audience and hopefully help more people.

I am 29F, 160 cm.I am starting a Journal to to track my weightloss journey to drop 43 kg using Rybelsus. I will give a monthly update and also notes on how to improve the experience. I also have hypothyroidism and have been taking levothyroxin.

**3 mg**

1. July 2025- lost 4 kg
2. August 2025 - lost 3 kg
3. September 2025 -lost 3 kg

**7 mg**

4. October 2025 - just starting 7 mg . Will keep you updated.

**Notes:**

* I have been using Healthifyme app to keep track of my calories daily.I eat around 1200-1050 calories daily. I sometimes exceed it but if I do so one day , I tend to eat lesser calories the next day.I don't do this consciously but It's like my body is trying to even out the high calorie intake of the day before.
* I got gastro in the first few weeks when I started it because I didn't eat my first meal of the day until 3 pm. After this experience , I started eating smaller meals throughout the day and haven't had any issues since.
* First few weeks was difficult as my sense of smell was also heightened . I could smell everyone's Body ordour and also the smell of spice in food threw me off. All good now.
* I don't restrict myself . I eat what I want but in moderation. I also feel like I get nauseous when I eat too much sugar now so I tend to eat less of it. I also feel weird if I eat oily food and Gluten often - so i've reduced that too.Symptoms if I eat too much of these are diarrhea , bloating and fatigue. I also try to eat enough protein daily but I don't always hit my daily protein goal.
* I had low energy in the beginning but feels better now. Could also be due to hypothyroidism.
* I also take Vitamin D3 , B complex and Folic Acid daily.
* I exercise 1-3 times for 10-15 mins in an eliptical per week.
* I also exfoliate by body twice per week and apply Palmers Toning and firming Cream every night. I am aware that I might get loose skin but this is an effort to reduce it as much as possible.
* I have a bit of hairloss but hoping to reverse it when my thyroid levels are back and the daily vitamins are kicking in.
* I am also South asian so I am doing this in on a south asian diet. This means Rice, Dhal, coconut based curries and the lots.",4,2,2025-10-10T11:24:23,Semaglutide,https://www.reddit.com/r/Semaglutide/comments/1o2swqm/my_weightloss_journey_on_semaglutiderybelsus/,1.0,True,/r/Semaglutide/comments/1o2swqm/my_weightloss_journey_on_semaglutiderybelsus/

1llihcg,InvestigatorFuzzy545,Help with managing Rybelsus side effects,"31F, Target weight 125, Start weight 155, Current weight 149

I've been on Rybelsus for about 7 weeks. Started at 3mg and had no weight loss or side effects (great, as expected). I moved to 6mg (two pills) for a week to finish the box and then to 7. It took about a week for the 7s to start having an impact, but since then I'm losing about 2 pounds a week and having almost zero appetite (I'm eating <1000 cal/day). At first there was a little nausea in the mornings, but nothing too bad.

This was fine for a couple of weeks, but in the last five days or so I've started having intense nausea that now lasts all day, and I've been throwing up almost every day. Which is particularly unfun when there's basically nothing in my stomach. Tonight I managed the first full meal I've had since Saturday without puking, thankfully. But this is interfering with my life, and I really don't know how I can keep it up if it stays this bad. 

Any tips? After several weeks at 7, is it reasonable to expect things to just get better with time? Should I skip every third day or something to lower the amount in my system? Take a break for a week? Has anyone noticed particular foods that sit better or worse?",3,15,2025-06-27T07:48:58,Semaglutide,https://www.reddit.com/r/Semaglutide/comments/1llihcg/help_with_managing_rybelsus_side_effects/,1.0,True,/r/Semaglutide/comments/1llihcg/help_with_managing_rybelsus_side_effects/

I was told previously that injections will work better but if 14mg is not working already then how should I expect the same composition to work in injection format. Anyone else who experienced the same? 

If I do switch to injection, will I have to start with a lower dose again?

1mv76tr,Agitated_Fun_856,My experience with Rybelsus (semaglutide) on alternate-day dosing,"  
  
I‚Äôm on **Rybelsus 14 mg every other day** (alternate-day dosing) for weight loss. I also take **Escitalopram** for anxiety/depression. I have lost 9 kg in 35 days. 

Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve noticed:

* **On days I take Rybelsus** ‚Üí I feel great. Clear thinking, calm mood, motivated, not hungry, no brain fog.
* **On the ‚Äúoff day‚Äù** (since it‚Äôs alternate day), usually fine, because the drug is still in my system.
* **When I miss a scheduled dose completely** (so it‚Äôs longer than my normal gap), the next day feels rough:
   * more anxious/irritable
   * less motivated
   * cloudy head/brain fog
   * more hunger
* As soon as I take the next dose, within a couple hours, all those bad feelings go away and I‚Äôm back to normal.

From what I understand, semaglutide (Rybelsus) has a **long half-life (\~7 days)**, which is why alternate-day dosing still works okay. But if I miss more than that rhythm, I can really feel the dip.

What surprised me is how much it affects my **mind and mood**, not just appetite. Honestly, on Rybelsus days I feel sharper and more stable mentally, which I didn‚Äôt expect.

So my questions are:

* Has anyone else noticed **mood/clarity changes** with GLP-1 meds?
* Is alternate-day dosing common/okay, or should I go back to daily?
* Do your ‚Äúmissed dose‚Äù symptoms feel similar?

Would love to hear others‚Äô experiences.

Hi all, I have been taking Rybelsus 3mg for a month. And continuing 3mg for the next month as well. The weight reduction has been primarily because of appetite suppression and low food intake (1200 to 1600 calories). I was one of those persons who could not stop devouring food. Now I don't get hunger pangs or anything. The drug started working from day 1.

I have not done any exercise yet. I have not completely cut down on sugar either. It has really been a life changer for me since I have been struggling with my weight for a very long time. Just so you know, I was not diabetic or prediabetic before. Also, I faced very minimal side effects.

If you have any questions, let me know, especially if you are from India. I will try to answer them. My girlfriend is a doctor and she suggested me Semaglutide.

1m2wt10,Beneficial-Dust8727,Anyone else sensitive to Rybelsus 3mg? Crashed after 4 days in a row,"Started Rybelsus 3mg last week. Took it 6 days in a row (first 2 not properly, then 4 days following full protocol, empty stomach, water, upright, waited 60‚Äì90 mins to eat).

By day 4 I was wiped out, bad nausea, reflux, fatigue, even threw up. Appetite totally gone.

I‚Äôm guessing the 4 proper doses stacked up in my system, especially since I was waiting longer than the 30 mins before eating.

Thinking of taking a full break and maybe just doing 1x/week next time or M/W/F max.

Anyone else had this level of sensitivity? Did a lower frequency work better for you?

12m3ofr,ant3ka,Weight loss journey 6 weeks in (Rybelsus),"I started on 3mg of Rybelsus daily on 03MAR2023. My starting weight was 250 lbs and I've been weighing myself every Friday.
After Week 1 - 247.2 (2.8 lost that week, 2.8 total)
After Week 2 - 245.8 (1.4 lost that week, 4.2 total)
After Week 3 - 243.0 (2.8 lost that week, 7.0 total)
After Week 4 - 242.8 (0.2 lost that week, 7.2 total)
Very inconsistent weight loss, I was a little less hungry, but was still having to count calories and struggling to stay on 1500 calories daily.

After 30 days, I moved up to 7mg of Rybelsus daily.
After Week 5 - 239.4 (3.4 lost that week, 10.6 total)
After Week 6 - 236.4 (3.0 lost that week, 13.6 total)
Wow, what a change by going up to a higher dose!! I have so much more energy, no more cravings, and for the first time in my life I feel like the weight is coming off without starving myself. 

For anyone just starting out, it can be frustrating at 3mg, but stick with it!! Your body has to get used to the medication and adjust, and then once you step up your dosage you'll hopefully start to really see the progress. I'm pleased with my journey after 45 days and can't wait to continue.

Edit to update for another 4 weeks!

7mg of Rybelsus daily
Week 7 was on vacation and didn't weigh
After Week 8 - 236.4 (0.0 lost that week, 13.6 total)
After Week 9 - 234.4 (1.8 lost that week, 15.6 total)
After Week 10 - 232.6 (1.8 lost that week, 17.4 total)
After Week 11 - 231.8 (1.8 lost that week, 18.6 total)

I feel like when I was on vacation I definitely was eating beyond when I was actually full. Once I got back to my normal schedule it does seem to have settled down to losing 1.8 pounds a week. I have another month on the 7mg and then we'll see if I get moved up once more or stay put.",73,73,2023-04-14T22:25:17,Semaglutide,https://www.reddit.com/r/Semaglutide/comments/12m3ofr/weight_loss_journey_6_weeks_in_rybelsus/,0.97,True,/r/Semaglutide/comments/12m3ofr/weight_loss_journey_6_weeks_in_rybelsus/

I went to Indiamart, had text conversations with several Indian chemist shops, and was ultimately able to locate a supplier who was willing to ship 2 months worth of Novo Nordisk Rybelsus for the Indian government mandated price (printed on any box of Indian pharmaceuticals), plus 25$ service and shipping -- a very fair deal.

1mz4fd1,Sweet-Efficiency-501,Does daily time consistency of taking Rybelsus matter?,"This is probably my third post regarding this pill and I apologise for it. I suffer through depression but I am on my way into coming out of it. Due to it I sometimes wake up at 5AM, some days 9AM and some days between 12-3PM. Hence, my wake up time is never consistent. But I do always take the pill as soon as I wake up and wait at least an hour before consuming anything. I sleep 6-7 hours at least before I take the pill. Ofcourse, it is not working and I feel like an idiot even asking this. But I have been to my GP and she says this should not affect anything as long as you take it at least 6 hours after eating anything and wait for at least 30 minutes.   
Lately I also have this weird sensitivity in my legs like small rashes which come and go but they started a couple of days after I started 14mg.

Currently I have done:  
30 days - 3mg (no side effects)  
30 days - 7mg (nausea but taking pills for it thanks to the suggestions here)  
14 days - 14mg (no nausea but seeing small rashes which go away as well)

I want to ask if consistency does matter when it comes to taking it? Or if anyone who has a similar experience?   
I cannot believe it doesn't and it being okay considering it has not been working thus far but I have also heard people saying it takes 8-12 weeks for it to work on 14mg.

1lk5xrz,Dense_Ad4546,Questions for Canadians on Rybelsus,"Hello. I'm a 53 year-old woman who is at the end of her rope with weight loss. I'm considering Rybelsus. I've done it all -- Weight Watchers, dietiticans, nutritionists, intermittent fasting, walking, weights, CICO, calorie deficit. I even embraced the anti-diet, body acceptance, intuitive eating approach. I'm approximately 40 lbs overweight. A tight size 14 who just wants to be a size 10.

In 2022, I was diagnosed with pre-diabetes. I weighed 217lbs and  I managed to lose 50 lbs using calorie counting, calorie deficit, stationary bike and some free weights. I've since gained 25 lbs back. (I cannot track food for the rest of my life, and I'm someone who finds exercise boring for the most part). I get my AIC checked once or twice a year and as far as I know, it's normal at the moment.

For what it's worth, I had a total thyroidectomy in 2006 and have been taking synthetic thyroid ever since. I also have yet to hit menopause. My cycle is like clockwork, and I'm so done with it!

With all of this, do you think I'd be a candidate for Rybelsus? And do you have any advice on making your case to your doctor/nurse practitioner? And anyone with Sun Life as your insurance provider -- have you had any luck with coverage? Finally, have any of you used a service like [Felix.ca](http://Felix.ca) and was it a positive experience?

1lwgziy,Cheese_is_my_fave,Moving from Rybelsus to Wegovy - thoughts?,"Ok - I did Wegovy last year for 4-5 months and lost about 21lb. But - when I moved up to 1mg I found the symptoms - diarrhea and vomiting - were just amplified and I really struggled. I really struggled having my favourite things - coffee and wine - tasted horrendous to me (don't shoot me down, I just like a few glasses at the weekend). I am v social too so eating out/having a few drinks was just a bust. I had a burger and 2 wine spritz one night and was chucking up every 2 mins, just horrid.

Anyway, I came off it and inevitably gained 10lb straight away üòÜ and struggled to reverse it for the last 9 months. Upon research I decided to try Rybelsus and I am currently on 7mg with only minimal side effects (dry mouth, nausea, dizziness, but nothing too extreme).

The weight loss has not been amazing - I have only lost about 6 lbs and I have come back from holiday actually 2lb heavier than I went. So 4lb for 2 months expense - ¬£340/$460 However, on the upside, it has limited my appetite and I have not done my usual holiday 'fuck it' and ate everything plus sides. So it has helped me stay controlled and I still enjoyed all the good stuff without going OTT.

However, to the point. So my provider has said they are no longer providing Rybelsus for weight loss and want to switch me to Wegovy. They suggested 1mg as it's the Rybelsus 7mg equivalent. I raised that I struggled in this last time and they said I am welcome to go back to 0.5 no issues. My qu for your thoughts are - on the equivalent dose of Ryblesus my side effects are minimal. As my body is now used to it shall I just go for 1mg? Or go back to 0.5mg? What would you do/have done if you have experienced this?

For context: 
- I am 5'2"" and original SW 176lb
- Wegovy Jan-May 2024 lost approx 21lb
- Off Wegovy gained 10lb back
- Started Rybelsus May 2025, SW 163lb
- CW 159lb

I know it's not super heavy but being small I am still in that overweight BMI (although we all know BMI is shite)

I know I look and feel waaayyyy better when I am 134lb max, pref 127 ish. I'll even settle for 140 üòÜ

I have struggled big time for the last 8 years as I have gotten a bit older, now 43 (F) with eating little and still gaining. My husband even comments on how little I eat compared to him, 1200kcal most days it's so frustrating. Sema definitely help me stay more consistent and prob below the 1200 cals. I easily make 10k + steps most days.

Any thoughts appreciated.

1lzdnlv,ReenieBeanie14,switching between rybelsus and ozempic. then back to rybelsus again.,"so I started Rybelsus Aug of 2024, starting weight was 132.4kg (291.9 pounds). my weight reached a plateau, stopping at 119kg (262 pounds) since March. my doctor prescribed me ozempic on May since my weight wouldn't budge no matter what I do. I started losing again and was surprised to reach a plateau so fast at 117kg (258 pounds) and that went on for a while. I realised my appetite on ozempic wasn't the same as it was on Rybelsus. in fact, I couldn't stop thinking about sweets and stayed clear of salads which wasn't the case with rybelsus. so out of sheer curiosity, I started back on rybelsus 2 days days ago, making sure the 7 days of ozempic was up first before I pop rybelsus and sure enough, I craved for salads again and found eating to be somewhat unappealing again. I weighed myself this morning and saw that my weight is now 115kg (253 pounds).

I actually wanted to start injections, but in my country doctors don't give them to you if you are 'only' overweight. I have 40kg to lose but all my blood work was fine so all I got was Rybelsus. I thought well, let's give it a try since I haven't been able to lose weight on my own. 

I started last Saturday. So today was the 4th morning taking the pill and the dose is only 3mg. Is it actually possible that I'm already feeling the difference? Or is it some sort of placebo effect? I haven't had any side effects but I could swear I have started feeling full after meals. Like before I could just keep going forever because I love food, enjoy eating and I never felt really full. I had this reel going in my head about food, thinking what to eat next, then shaming myself because I know I shouldn't eat that much, then end up eating anyhow just to feel better. All of this has stopped, I actually have to remind myself to eat. I find my self wondering like oh, is this how you're supposed to feel after you eat? Like somehow the brain is telling me ok darling, you're full now, you can stop eating. I don't remember hearing that voice in my head before.

1l46s4u,Cheese_is_my_fave,Trying Rybelsus after wegovy,"Hi, last year I did wegovy from January - April and lost about 21lb. As the doses went up I found my body struggled to handle the side effects including some horrendous episodes of vomiting and diarrhea. So I stopped. However ... I gained back about 14lb and just kept doing the 7lb flirt - 7 off, 7 back on again after a good weekend. Anyway, having thought about the positives and wanting to get a shove on again I have decided to try Rybelsus and wondered if anyone else has experience. Reasons being:

It's a low dose. If I do ok on the low dose I may just microdose my way to success
It's a tablet - I can travel and take this with me

Almost 2 weeks in so far and I can feel the food noise slowly switching off, feeling fuller and not desperate for all the snacks.

Have lost about 4lb which is decent so far!

My side effects have been pretty much ZERO so far apart from a bit of a dry mouth. Even on my first dose of wegovy - possibly 0.25? - I experienced bad headaches, almost like a constant low-key hangover with none of the joy from the night before.

For context, I am in the obese BMI category at 160lb at the moment. Aiming for 130-140ish. I am only 158cm or 5 foot 2 inches.

Has anyone else had success this way? Am willing to try tirz after this if required.

1ecx4wt,Littlebunz95,Taking Metformin after Compounded Semaglutide ,"Hello, 

  
For the past 10 months I have been taking compounded semaglutide through BMImd. My main goal was weight loss, and I had great success. I lost about 25-30 pounds (I mostly focused on how I felt, not the scale.) 

I was planning on continuing my use- I was about 10 pounds away from maintenance- until an article came out in early July linking semaglutide to possible vision loss. To put in context: my father has macular degeneration, and even though he's had a heart transplant and several types of cancer, he says that macular degeneration has been the worst, and it's affected my perception greatly. 

I stopped taking compounded semaglutide at the beginning of July out of fear, and now since my system has calmed down, I'm debating what my next move should be. 

My body is starting to feel really crappy without the semaglutide (I think it was also helping treat some undiagnosed condition, in addition to the weight loss.) So I'm debating restarting with a better telehealth provider- like mochi- or switching to Metformin- Topiramate med kit from Hers. 

Has anyone had any luck losing weight with either Metformin or Topiramate, or both? Has anyone had luck losing weight on these meds after switching from Compounded Semaglutide?

However, there's a caveat to using this miracle drug... Once you stop taking it, the weight can come right back if you're not careful. 

I felt like I should warn anyone looking to start using it. Losing weight quickly is a great feeling, but keeping it off is even better. Which is why the slow and steady route is better. 

Just simply watch your diet and exercise 2-3 times a week if you're starting out. The longer it takes to get the weight off, the easier it'll be to keep it off.

135y1sg,DaveyBlahBlah,Weight Loss is Impossible for Me.,"Hi everyone. I am mainly writing this for cathartic reasons. I have struggled with weight my entire life and I never feel like talking to my friends or tweeting about it quite captures my life. I welcome any comments, criticisms, or words of support.

&#x200B;

TLDR: I'm a smart guy and have had some success in the past, but I'm the fattest I've ever been and can't shift even a single pound anymore despite exercising harder and eating better than I ever have. Considering e.g. testosterone or something else drastic to boost my attempts.

&#x200B;

\-----

My background info is that I'm 31, male, 5'11"". I am a registered healthcare professional in Genetics and have multiple degrees in Genetics/biology, so I would consider myself to be well-educated, and after years of attempting weight loss and exercise I don't feel I have much to learn about the ""science"" of weight loss.

&#x200B;

I  have always struggled with my weight ever since I was a child. I was always the fattest child in the classroom and was always teased and bullied for it. At my peak, I weighed nearly 17 stone (about 235lbs or 107kg). This was when I left school in 2009 and moved to University. I lost a little bit by virtue of walking across the city all the time but remained heavy.

&#x200B;

It wasn't until 2010 that I found a personal trainer in a friend at my part-time job who was hoping to build up a client base and portfolio, so he took me on for free 3x a week. He was a runner by trade and I had zero gym experience, so we largely worked on HIIT/cardio work. At this point I didn't pay attention to my diet in the slightest and lived mostly on ""student dinners"" and alcohol - surprisingly, I managed to lose around 3 stone in weight and I got down to my best ever weight and figure at 12.5 stone (about 77kg). Sadly my PT moved to another city and I noticed the weight slowly climb back up over the next year.

&#x200B;

By 2014 I had put on a bit more weight after a period of depression and unemployment and I ended up back at around 14 stone (88kg) before moving to another city after University. I exercised regularly (3-4 times week), ate well, and struggled to see any changes. I got a new PT who was great and introduced me to weight training. I never really saw any changes on the scales or in the mirror. This is when I started to have my biggest issues.

&#x200B;

No matter what I did with diet or exercise, I could not shift any weight. It got to a point where I was worried about diabetes or hormone imbalances and saw my doctor. They weren't too worried and sent me on my way with some normal diabetes tests.

&#x200B;

I continued to struggle and sought some other options. I took some over-the-counter medicine called Orlistat. I used to work in Pharmacy so I'm confident in its use. Basically it binds to dietary fat and prevents it from being absorbed, and it gives you some nasty digestive side effects if you ingest too much fat. I tried this for a month and never saw a gram of difference and never had any of the side effects, so I surmised my dietary fat intake wasn't too high.

&#x200B;

I went back to the doctor who referred me to a community education programme which was all about portion sizes, understanding macros and calories etc. It really wasn't for me. I understood all of that, it just wasn't working for me. I was in a class with morbidly obese people literally sat eating multipacks of crisps while this skinny dietician spoke about making 50% of your plate filled with vegetables. By this point I had climbed up to around 15 stone (95kg).

&#x200B;

I eventually found Slimming World. For those who haven't tried it, it's a group class every week following a diet plan. It assigns a ""Syn"" value to certain foods (usually junk) and allocates a maximum amount of Syns. Protein, most fruit and veg, and other foods are ""free"". In theory you could eat as much chicken as you want but a bar of chocolate might be too much. I am frustrated to admit that this helped initially. I don't understand what algorithm they use to determine the values for certain food groups (potatoes and pasta are free but a slice of bread takes out half my ""Syns"" for the day?), but I followed it religiously and got down to nearly 13 stone (about 83kg) and felt amazing again.

&#x200B;

Here's where it all goes downhill.

&#x200B;

Despite sticking to Slimming World, I plateaued at 13.5 stone. I eventually became frustrated with it at the same time I hit a really rough patch at work and I think I was deeply depressed and stressed. I climbed back up to around 14 stone. When I went back on plan, I couldn't lose the weight again. The exact plan that worked a few months before just...stopped working. And after about 2 months of doing it perfectly I gave up and stopped going. I went back to my doctor thinking, surely, now something is wrong with my body - but apparently I was fit as a fiddle.

&#x200B;

I moved to another city again in September 2019. I joined a private gym which involved training 5x a week, basically 3 days weights and 2 days cardio. It was one of those really ""lads lads lads"" muscle gyms and I joined a 12 week transformation programme. Basically every other lad went in like me and left with a six pack and a model photoshoot, and I left about 1lb lighter despite doing the same things as everyone else.

&#x200B;

I went to my *new* doctor at the end of my tether. i had full blood screens including testosterone (I had some body hair loss and was worried about testosterone levels). All completely normal besides low vitamin D (I am Scottish; the sun is a stranger to us). I had the ear of an older GP in a telephone appointment this time and he suggested I look into either hypnotherapy or bariatric surgery to change my habits or reduce my calorie intake. I explained I had no issue with overeating and I had been on 1600kcal a day for the last 6 weeks and didn't feel hungry, so I didn't think I had an issue with overeating either. He seemed to miss the fact I was training hard and eating light and still not seeing any changes on the scales or in my body.

&#x200B;

Then...COVID-19. We all put on weight. I work in the NHS (UK healthcare system). I was able to work from home but I never got a day off and, by the time the gyms opened again, I had crept up to 16.5 stone again (104kg). You may remember this is the weight I was when I left school exactly 10 years before, so when I realised my weight hit that high I felt the lowest I've been in a while, like 10 years of battling my weight and body image issues went down the drain for nothing.

&#x200B;

In August 2021, I got myself another PT. We really trained hard. We went through my diet with a fine tooth comb. We trained 2 times a week together and he set me 2-3 days of independent training a month. Between August 2021 and April 2022 I did lose weight, but it was about 6lbs in total taking me to 15 stone 11lbs. Less than 1lb a month of weight loss and side-by-side picture comparisons looked identical. And I'd plateaued for about 5 weeks.

&#x200B;

I had a long talk with my PT about the fact I just, frankly, hated coming to the gym. I never once had any 'endorphin rush' from a workout. After some reflection I realised I preferred more social workouts. Through a friend I ended up getting into a running group as well as CrossFit. I've been doing both consistently since April 2022 and it's the longest I've ever committed to consistent exercise. I had a bit of depression around October-December 2022 and lost some progress but overall finding I enjoy both of these things. I now do CrossFit 3x a week and run with the group 1x a week for 7-8k, and sometimes do a Parkrun at the weekend.

&#x200B;

You guessed it...I'm still not seeing any changes. My body image is as bad as it's ever been. My weight has remained flat at 16.4 stone (104kg) for all of 2023. I have home scales and have tried multiple different body composition devices, which all gives slightly different numbers (as you would expect) but they all consistently tell me I'm remaining the same in terms of body composition. So I have absolutely zero evidence that I am ""replacing fat with muscle"".

&#x200B;

My diet in the last 2-3 years has been the best it's ever been. In particular in the last 6 months I am consistently trying to achieve around 200g of protein per day with a calorie intake of around 2000kcal. Whenever I eat less I am told by everyone to eat more. Whenever I eat more I gain weight too easily.

&#x200B;

* I am constantly told to ""keep at it"" by people who only think I've been trying to lose weight for a few days and don't recognise I've never, not once, had a day in my life where I've not been thinking about losing weight.
* I am constantly told to either weigh myself every day or weigh myself once a week or NEVER WEIGH YOURSELF BECAUSE SCALES ARE AWFUL.
* I am constantly told that weight fluctuates but you should see gradual change over time.
* I am constantly told that the weight gain or static weight must be my fat being replaced by muscle.
* I am constantly told that I don't see body changes because maybe the water weight today is fluctuating upwards and it'll come down eventually.
* I am constantly told to just be happy that my body is healthy and can do what I need it to do.
* I am constantly told I might have body dysmorphia and I'm not actually fat despite being the fattest person in all my groups and am objectively obese by every metric.
* I am constantly told that weight loss is a simple calories out > calories in equation but no one can really explain why my calories out aren't resulting in weight loss.

&#x200B;

I am just utterly fed up that my body just doesn't seem to respond to weight loss. I feel like I have to work 10x harder than my peers to lose a single pound and it will go back on and then some if I have the temerity to have a sociable weekend at the pub. I am sick of bleeding myself to death in the gym all the time and constantly feeling exhausted just to end up exactly the same weight. I am at the end of my tether hearing people tell me I look fine when I look in the mirror and see the worst version of myself.

&#x200B;

I'm aware I've been seeking a 'medical' answer to my problems that may not exist. I'm also aware I have had periods of success - but these inevitably always get cancelled out by an acute period of taking my foot off the pedal and I never seem to recover those losses again.

&#x200B;

My next avenue is exploring methods of acquiring testosterone. My thinking is if I CAN actually boost any muscle gain then I will benefit from being able to work even harder in the gym and tip the figurative scales in a favourable direction. I'm not fussed about being a bodybuilder but *something* to get me out of this rut is absolutely necessary.

&#x200B;

If you've got this far, thank you for reading. I don't know what I expect or want from this thread. I just can't talk to anyone around me or my usual social media about this anymore because I invariably get some well-meaning 'advice' in one of the bullet points above that just...doesn't work for me anymore.

&#x200B;

\----

&#x200B;

UPDATE: based on some comments below I thought I'd clarify a few points:

* I do admit to going through periods of giving my diet and exercise 100%, and when I see no changes after 4-6 weeks I get really disheartened by seeing no progress in pictures, the scales, or body composition metrics (I have no evidence of 'replacing fat with muscle' for example). When I get disheartened I go ""fuck it"" and just stop tracking any food until the next time I think I've had an epiphany and sussed the problem. But the fundamental issue remains that when I track calories and exercise hard, I don't see any benefits.

&#x200B;

* I'm fully aware that my mental health and weight seem to be linked. Thankfully, for a long time, I've been fairly stable. My issues were things like unemployment and an awful working environment which are all long past me and I have a fairly good life these days. The only thing that triggers any state of depression currently is being jaded by failed attempts at weight loss. So if I were able to lose weight effectively I am confident I'd be even happier!

&#x200B;

* When tracking, I am meticulous with all calories. Every morsel gets tracked on MFP. Two PTs in the past have remarked that it doesn't make sense that I work as hard as I do with the diary I present to them and see no change. I'm not ""secret eating"" or omitting things like cooking oil.

&#x200B;

* I continue to be frustrated by the mixed messaging of critics. One camp screams ""calories in minus calories out, it's that simple!"" and suggest there's not a single other factor that can affect weight loss, while another camp says I clearly don't understand biology, suggesting that it's not quite as simple as calories in minus calories out. And, as I'm trying to communicate, unless my BMR is hundreds of calories lower than it should be, I am demonstrably in a calorie deficit and still seeing no results.

&#x200B;

* I appreciate the comments asking me to consider being happier in my own skin and changing my expectations are in the right place. However I am objectively obese, I don't have an athletic build, I wear XL clothes, I'm physically and mentally uncomfortable, and quite frankly I deserve to be slimmer than I am. I feel trapped inside this hideous body.

&#x200B;

* I can't access e.g. semaglutide in the UK as I don't actually qualify without something like diabetes, but the longer I remain at this weight the more at risk I am of developing it!",31,68,2023-05-03T01:12:18,WeightLossAdvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/135y1sg/weight_loss_is_impossible_for_me/,0.76,True,/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/135y1sg/weight_loss_is_impossible_for_me/

1ibsl6r,MsRightHere,Things I've learned on my weightloss/health gain journey...,"Some of these things may sound obvious but I am gonna say them because it might not be obvious to someone.

1. Get a baseline.
Not just your starting weight, but go to the doctor and figure out what is happening in your body. If physically able, measure what your body can do (how long/far can you walk, how many 5lb overhead presess can you do before you get tired. Whatever works for you). 

2. Get a good therapist if you need one.
In all my years I have rarely met someone that was obese who had their shit fully together. This process churns up stuff. Be prepared. 

3. A nutritionist isn't the same as a dietitian. (And most GPs haven't had much nutrition education)
There is a lot of good and bad info out there. Do yourself a favor and find someone that at least has a professional accreditation. If they give you a calorie intake goal without calculating your active metabolic rate.... run. 

4. The path is not straight.
You will have good days and bad days. You will see progress and then all of a sudden plateau. Focus on the trend line versus any one snapshot. Focus on your behaviors more than your results. 

5. Even if you think you are eating enough vegetables you should probably eat some more. Seriously. 

6. Hate exercise? Then try to remember how you liked to play as a kid. You are more likely to keep it up if you don't think of it as a chore. That initial momentum will help. 

7. Cool you have an exercise streak... but have you ever tried stopping? 
Recovery is important. I have seen some people who go from couch potato to people unable to take a day off. You can't replace one addiction with another. 

8. Stop comparing yourself to others and sometimes even yourself.
You are you and this is now. It is okay to mourn the loss of who you were. But the person you are now is the one that has to do all the hard work.

9. There is no ""easy way"" to lose weight. Even WLS or semaglutides are hard. So be gentle with yourself and others. Let's not get into a pissing match over each other's journey. 

10. Seriously, eat more veggies. ",7,0,2025-01-28T09:05:30,WeightLossAdvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/1ibsl6r/things_ive_learned_on_my_weightlosshealth_gain/,0.82,True,/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/1ibsl6r/things_ive_learned_on_my_weightlosshealth_gain/

xjl7e8,LenLenn,"410 lbs; I need help, bad. Worried about my future.","I'm 17, Male, 5'2 (Both of my parents are short), and currently sitting at 410lbs. Right off the bat, I think you can see how this is a serious issue. I'm genuinely worried about my future, and I feel like now would be the best time to change, before I become a legal adult. Life is enjoyable for me, and I have no intentions on cutting it short. I want to live it to the fullest, but I'm going to have serious health risks in my future is nothing changes and I continue to go down this route. I have hope that I can change, but I'm not entirely sure what I should do.

**How It Came to Be:**

I've consistently been eating above normal portion sizes pretty much my entire life. Not only that, but I don't eat vegetables, like, at all.. my parents never really forced me to eat them growing up, and I've just never really caught onto them. I'm a picky eater, and eat the same foods consistently, never bothering to change it or switch things up. Guessing it's because I don't like change, and prefer eating things I'm familiar with. I eat a ton of carbohydrates and dairy products. (like pasta, fries, anything with cheese, etc.) I don't really get much physical activity, and stay on my PC for most of the day talking to friends. Bad habits, like eating food as a coping mechanism, and eating just straight out of pure boredom.

**Other Things To Consider:**

* I'm diagnosed with ADHD, and currently take Vyvanse (which also semi-helps with feeling the need to eat after breakfast, up until lunch.)
* I don't drink anything other than water, so I can't cut out flavored drinks from my diet because I don't drink any to begin with.

**What I'm Doing About It (So Far), & My Current Plans/Goals:**

* I have pretty much completely removed my bad habit of eating out of boredom. And just eating snacks in general.
* I was thinking about going on a diet at first, but I figured that would be too much for me, for at least starting out that is. For now, I'm going to try my absolute best to follow portion sizes.
* Going to start exercising everyday if I can on my treadmill, and on days I don't, I will try and eat less.
* My first goal is to reach below the 400 mark, because if I am able to, I will at least know that I am losing weight. If for whatever reason I cannot reach this mark, I will have to try more extreme measures like going on a diet, or something of the likes.
* My last goal will probably be around 150, but I'm unsure.
* I have been heavily thinking about getting gastric surgery, and currently questioning if I should or not.

**My Questions:**

1. How many Calories should I aim for per day. I really have no idea.
2. Whats a good weekly weight loss goal?
3. Should I get gastric surgery? And if so, when? or under what condition?

Are my current plans/goals good? or should I modify them?   
I will greatly appreciate any form of feedback, weather it be a few sentences, or a whole essay.

1gr6j2g,OnToGreenerGables,"""Mentally"" incapable of losing weight?","Tl;dr: I think I'm mentally incapable of making the changes required to lose weight. 

So obviously I know that no one is physically incapable of losing weight, but what about mentally? 

I have been trying to lose weight on again off again since 2015. I've tried everything, done different diets, intermittent fasting, spent half my week in the gym, even Semaglutide drugs. 

Everytime I DO see returns on my effort and I'm happy with my progress for a time, and then slowly everything just bends back to normal, my weight loss and muscle gain plateaus, my diet slowly goes back being normal, and my progress slowly gets reset. 

It's not even that I get depressed or upset with plateauing. It just happens and then everything warps back to the way it was before. It's like I'm mentally incapable of the escalation required to keep pushing my weight loss or mentally incapable of keeping the mindset.

And it's not like I forget or that I decide that I won't continue with my lifestyle changes anymore. I am acutely aware that I should be in the gym or that I should be eating differently but it's like I'm screaming inside my own mind trying to force myself to make the right decisions but that doesn't translate into my actions. 

I know that being overweight is bad for my physical and mental health, I am aware of the effects it has own my social life, my romantic life, I am not happy in my own body and when I say I would do anything to change that I 100% mean it with every fiber of my being.

180jlvr,IamAMelodyy,"Wanting to eat junk food is engraved in my mind, how has it left yours?","I hope the title speaks for itself. I am female 21, I looked GOOD just 2 months ago but I keep gaining and loosing the same weight. I have tried multiple methods, I know everything about loosing weight (caloric deficit, methods like counting calories, fasting, gym, etc.).

Every time I am succeeding, liike, any instance where I see 'wow if I keep going like this I will see results in 2 weeks', then I get so much anxiety. Food just does not leave my mind from there on. It's not in my control. It's engraved in my mind until I give in to the craving. And if I don't I feel an eating disorder or bad relationship with food creeping up slowly, so I do give in (and I lose quality of life just walking around like a zombie who has nothing else to think about but food).

I think this is anxiety. Other people here who have had this, what do you do? It's always when I realise I am succeeding that my mind pulls the plug, thinks about food, and the craving just does not go away. Keeping the craving and this level of self control is not sustainable at all, so I know I will give in eventually, and if I don't, then I will give up in 1-2 weeks latest. I eat good amounts of healthy/important foods so there's no vitamin/mineral deficiency, I make sure to go to the gym regularly, so that's good as well. I also sleep enough as of most recently. Any tips for this food being engraved in my mind once I realise I am on the right track?

1fkh5ku,eynfro,"Lost 50KG (110lbs) in 6 months, ask me stuff","# 

As the title says, I've managed to lose 50kg in what I consider is quite a big amount of weight in this timeframe (120 to 70kg), if you have any questions on my methods please feel free to ask.

The key takeaways are:

* GLP-1 receptor agonists, Liraglutide, Semaglutide, Tirzepatide, Retatrutide, use them, they will completely change your life, it makes your ""surges"" to binge eat way more rare, and even if you decide to binge, you won't be physically able to ingurgitate such amounts of foods that will make you gain weight at any given day. Obviously, do not get Ozempic, it is ridiculously overpriced compared to raws you get elsewhere, and it's weaker than Tirzepatide (the one I used, works perfectly) and Retratrutide.
* Exercise is overrated, exercise is important for cardiovascular health and 100 other benefits, however, when it comes to weight loss itself the body is extremely efficient at using energy for movement and the amount you'll burn will be quite disappointing (often less than just not eating this 50g more of pasta), and the body likes stability, if you somehow managed to burn 300 kcal in a cardio session, your body will make you walk less, move less, sleep more, which will inevitably counterbalance the calories you lost. Of course, if you ENJOY a form or cardio and like doing it absolutely do it, it can only be beneficial, but if you hate it and lose your breath in 5 minutes, go slow, walk more, there is no need to rush things which brings me to my next point
* Walk more, passively, walking isn't very intensive on the body so it won't make you that tired, try to incorporate it into everyday life without allocating a specific time to do it if you can, for example park your car 15 minutes from work, and talk, this extra 30 minutes of walk if done everyday will make a difference in both fat loss and cardio health in the long term, especially if you try to walk faster and faster.
* Eat shit you like, do not eat broccoli or spinach if you don't like it, make recipes that actually make you want to eat them, my examples are low-kcal bolognese where i'd use no oil, half ground turkey half ground lean beef with a much lesser portion of pasta, or low-kcal tortilla wraps where I'd put grilled chicken and some yogurt based garlic and herb sauce, or some no-kcal bbq sauce, which taste quite nice, make thing you like, but less of it
* Absolutely use low-kcal or no-kcal version of stuff if it helps you sustain your diet, no kcal sodas, low kcal sauces, icebreaker chewing-gums, no kcal jell-o all of that, use it. Yes, some of those are not IDEAL, health wise, but eating a moderate amount of this for a few month if it keeps you sticking to your goals it will be FAR more beneficial.

1ddlb7m,Hotjoe91,Why am I losing weight so slowly?,"I'm a 33 year old male, about 5'11"" and 235 lbs

I understand that I'm not exactly a spring chicken anymore at 33 but I feel like I am being pretty aggressive with my efforts along with taking Semaglutide and yet I am not losing nearly as much as I should. Here is a rundown of my weekly habits if anyone would like to shout at me for doing something wrong, please do.

As mentioned before I am on Semaglutide 100 units weekly so I don't find it too difficult to keep my base daily calorie intake at 1,200. I chose this intake based on my BMR of around 2,000-2,100 for a ~800 calorie deficit. I increase it accordingly of course depending on if I exercise that day and track my calories with Samsung Health + My Fitness Pal.

I work Mon-Fri and my diet during the week is typically a Premier protein shake first thing in the morning, then a sugarfree Chobani yogurt before lunch, then another shake at lunchtime, then a prepackaged Publix salad in early afternoon normally. I sometimes will switch this early afternoon meal up to keep my sanity. My gym days are Tues-Thurs-Saturday. I do 40 mins of ~6 MPH treadmill on Tues and Thurs and weight training on Saturdays to maintain muscle with 20 mins of cardio after weights. After each gym session I make a 2 scoop whey protein shake with a little skim milk and a large banana. I drink half the shake right after the gym then the other half a couple hours later. I fill in the rest of my calorie needs with whatever else I want throughout the night but rarely blow the calorie limit.  On weekends I sort of wing it on meals. This does not mean I stop counting calories. I just eat whatever I feel like but I STILL count the calories. By ""wing it"" I only mean there's no meal plan like on weekdays. I still try to get at least 120 grams of protein through shakes per day,, any more through dietary.

On paper I should be losing 2 pounds per week if not more. It is going much slower than that I cannot figure out why. Sometimes I will go days without losing any weight and my Withings scale will actually say I GAINED fat which I find insane. Fat from where? My guess is I am not doing meals correctly and am letting my metabolism grind to a halt at times. I am regularly doing cardio though so shouldn't my metabolism not be suffering? Should I be doing more?",1,2,2024-06-11T23:59:06,WeightLossAdvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/1ddlb7m/why_am_i_losing_weight_so_slowly/,0.66,True,/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/1ddlb7m/why_am_i_losing_weight_so_slowly/
199u3gc,Lastofthejekas,"Help me out, please","Hello Reddit, I come to you humbly for some advice and I‚Äôll be as transparent as possible about my habits good and bad. 

I am 5‚Äô4 F 32. 

When I was very fit and working out about two hours several times a week, doing weight training and also 40 min cardio burning 400 calories just on cardio, 4 times a week I was on average 150 lbs and maintained that up until I moved in with my current bf, in which I started gaining weight very quickly. I admit it was stressful for me the first two years. 

We‚Äôre going on 4 years living together and I‚Äôm now 180 lbs. I‚Äôve tried about every crash diet, I just tried ozempic last year and lost weight but I gained it all back when I stopped and 10lbs more. 

I recently tried keto, but after the first few lbs of water weight it was too difficult for me to maintain. 

I count my calories and I‚Äôm staying at 1.5k a day and maybe a bit more if I workout, I count the calories I burn. I workout less than before, but maybe around 40-1hr a day, at home strength and a walk. 

I just don‚Äôt understand why the weight keeps climbing up when I‚Äôm most definitely not on a 3.5k surplus. 

I do drink on the weekends. But that‚Äôs always been the case, it could be that being past 30 now the alcohol is affecting me worse? I eat some sweets, but I don‚Äôt binge them and I include them in my daily calorie intake. I‚Äôm losing hope, my head can‚Äôt wrap itself around continuously gaining weight. I do build muscle relatively fast, I have a stockier body type. 

Again, with my habits currently I don‚Äôt expect dramatic weight loss, but I can‚Äôt comprehend gaining and gaining. I‚Äôm starting to lose hope 

I‚Äôve had bloodwork done and the only thing off was my cholesterol. Thyroid and glucose apparently okay. The doctor tried to put me on the semaglutide medicine again but it didn‚Äôt do anything for me that round so I dropped it, I‚Äôm also scared of the weight bouncing back like it did before.",0,7,2024-01-18T21:59:50,WeightLossAdvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/199u3gc/help_me_out_please/,0.5,True,/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/199u3gc/help_me_out_please/

It can be so hard to lose weight when you struggle with hormonal imbalances; even when you're doing the right things. I finally found a doctor that understood me and didn't invalidate me. He has helped me get semaglutide and I recommend it to anyone else going through a similar situation as me.

16yct0v,LunarImpulses,Reducing Hunger?,"To preface, I'm not the individual to not eat, or eat non voluminous foods. I do IF, and use a caloric deficit. I am doing a 1000 calorie deficit. My day started with some hunger, I consumed a boiled egg, I went on a walk (1 Hour) after, the egg held me over for an hour or 2, after this I had a few pickles (5) then went on a 1 hour walk, after this I came home quite hungry and made myself a lunch, which was a bowl of noodles with Chicken Breast, broccoli, and rice noodles, I snacked on the food while cooking due to my hunger (I weighed the food raw), and also ate 2 slices of toast, from the butt end of a loaf I got from Walmart (I felt obligated to in a way) However I was still fairly hungry after, I decided to make brownies (A lower calorie kind, using Greek yogurt and a sucralose sweetener). I nibbled on the spoon and spatula while mixing. While they were cooking I had a small bowl of Cheerios, with almond milk, then 3 rice cakes with Greek yogurt. Then had about 5 brownies (#2 and #3 were smaller than the others being 25 grams, compared to the 50 of the others). I believe that the food consumed after my noodles was a binge. However (assuming I tracked properly) I still got to about maintenance calories, pulling me out of my goal deficit. Any advice to prevent future binges, and also the psychological connotation of obligation to eat food.

Im down to 300 pounds in 3 weeks, all I did was drink a gallon of water a day, incorporate vegetables in my diet and stopped putting creamer in my coffee.  It kinda sucks not having creamer but that helped me lose so much weight I feel like.

My weight loss goal is 200 lbs in a year, I think I can do it.  I also am using semaglutide and started that 2 weeks ago but was already down 5 pounds without the semaglutide.

u3ofcb,IndependentHalf,A Comprehensive Guide to Prescription weight medications,"***Controversial topic incoming!*** **New MD ('22) here!** I know that many people who are looking to lose weight would prefer a natural option without medication. But, prescription weight loss medication from a provider you have an established relationship with IN CONJUNCTION with lifestyle changes has a higher likelihood of producing sustainable results ([AACE Guidelines](https://pro.aace.com/disease-state-resources/nutrition-and-obesity/guidelines)). **Taking any medication is a very personal decision,** so please take this with a grain of salt and talk to a provider you trust. Also of note, many doctors are not comfortable prescribing medication for weight due to [long standing stigma](https://acpinternist.org/archives/2017/02/weight.htm). **This is just a passion project of mine, and something I've personally struggled with.**

For each of these, I'll walk through a brief overview of the mechanism, landmark trials showing evidence it works and in what population, and side effects/side effect rates\*\*. Noting what the placebo group did and comparing to the medications is also important.\*\*

Weight loss PILLS on the other hand (supplements, anything on amazon or Instagram/Facebook ads) are a whole different story, and should be avoided (more on this later).

Obesity Medicine is a relatively new specialty with many medications in its toolkit. ([ABOM](https://www.abom.org/)).

**Liraglutide (Victoza/Saxenda)**

*How it Works:* Liraglutide is a GLP-1 medication that was created for Type 2 Diabetes. By acting on GLP-1 receptors, your body is tricked into producing more leptin/less ghrelin, and feeling full. These receptors also delay the rate your stomach empties, making you feel full longer after a meal.

[The Lancet Trial](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673618317732?casa_token=UaytfcuTLKEAAAAA:PqAhMYpdjQZzUFIYwK79iOhlPXppj3HgxqeBqmb-7t3kuYUsLSAGB-RowKzH7gta-aLro9E4gA) showed that when compared to placebo, Liraglutide had 7.6% weight loss (placebo 2.3%) while Semaglutide had between 6-13.8% weight loss over 52 weeks. Everyone including placebo group in this study was asked to eat 500kcal below TDEE and was seen every 2 weeks for weeks 0-20 and every 4 weeks after until 52 weeks, and 150 min exercise/week was recommended.

[SCALE Trial:](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2428956) 12 weeks, in Type 2 Diabetics: Liraglutide had 4.7-6.0% weight loss (placebo 2.0%) over 12 weeks. 500kcal deficit with 150min/week exercise.

*Down Sides:* The biggest side effect is nausea, vomiting, and GI distress reported between 17-38% [depending on the dosage](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4010971/). Additionally, many, many insurances do not cover this medication for non-diabetics, and out of pocket it costs roughly $1000-$1200 per month. Victoza and Saxenda are injectables.

*Scary:* GLP-1 receptors are also in the Thyroid. There has been some evidence that both Liraglutide and Semaglutide [can increase risk of a rare thyroid c-cell cancer.](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/nda/2010/022341s000TOC.cfm) There's also evidence it increases risk of gallstones and pancreatitis.

**Semaglutide (Ozempic/Wegovy/Rybelsus)**

*Same mechanism* as Liraglutide, but reformulated as a more potent version, and higher reported weight loss. Again the same Down sides and Scary side effects as Liraglutide.

The STEP Trials were done to prove the efficacy of semaglutide for weight loss:[STEP 3](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2777025) showed that over 68 weeks, patients on 2.4mg Semaglutide lose 16.0% weight (5.7% Placebo). Impressively, 75% lost 10% or more, and 55% lost 15% or more over 68 weeks.

Of note: this study had the most intense placebo group I've ever seen. Take those high % with a grain of salt, given the exercise/diet regimen patients were on. For 8 weeks, everyone received Nutrisystem meal replacement at 1000-1200 cal/day. Then, patients transitioned to 1200-1800cal/day hypo-caloric diet for the remaining weeks. Everyone started on 100min exercise/week, increasing over 4 months by 25 min/week to 200min/week. They also had 30 individual dietician sessions over 68 weeks to walk through their diet and exercise.

*Down Sides:* See above

*Scary:* See above. This one is more expenseive ($1400/month sans insurance). You should be able to get coverage if you are T2 Diabetic, however.

**Phentermine (Adipex, Lomira, Qsymia (combo with Topiramate))**

*How it works:* Phentermine is a substituted amphetamine, meaning that in some ways it looks like an amphetamine but a [far, far milder, less addictive](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23736363/), and safer version. It has way less ""stimulant"" effect and more appetite suppression. It primarily works by decreasing appetite, decreasing the caloric intake of patients and thus, making it easier to maintain a caloric deficit. It by itself does not cause weight loss, and increases in metabolism are minimal, if any. However, given its similarity, it is Schedule IV drug and cannot be taken concurrently with other stimulants/medications that could increase blood pressure.

The topic of whether phentermine increases blood pressure or is ""bad for the heart"" has been extensively discussed and the conclusion is no. While many people remember ""fen-phen"" in the 80s and 90s, the ""fen"" that caused heart valve side effects was fenfluramine (recalled in the 90s), which is no longer mixed with phentermine. [Phentermine has actually shown to decrease blood pressure long term, given its impact on weight loss](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/oby.22430?casa_token=oDcwP0woKsUAAAAA%3AnIKHJXshNYNiFtfpJJ7wZV1wG-bHjsxkDeGgzFD-OfaEQhJDbWdkFYHH9_2ju45odaSJrMPTsxa7dxQ). It has no cardiovascular risk, in short or long term use. This is generally the most prescribed drug by obesity medicine providers, given it has been around since the 60s, is well-tolerated and generic (\~$25/month)

Phentermine alone has shown upto 7.5% weight loss when used long term [(24 months)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/oby.22430?casa_token=jSqv99F7RAwAAAAA%3AfJItcZ_uR_beI27ugJNg81kCf3sblGfvQLhvLQuVuW_CewF4hmIcLFDetAhucZ76S5YPLtxUiopVclw) in retrospective studies. When combined with Topiramate (either prescribed alone or as a combo med Qsymia) there are two large scale studies [CONQUER](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673611602055?casa_token=ctLgtdrYXccAAAAA:72m5nsxAVuQ32e3h1gzwZ6vOzhPahT4OqQBd-tSprcP1F_m4nnMAD3QMeYFRveEkTKPVpDTBdg) and [SEQUEL](https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article/95/2/297/4576717?login=true)) patients lost between 9.3-10.5% (1.2% for placebo).

The placebo group in this study was given a LEARN manual on what foods to eat, seen every 4 weeks (including an extra visit at week 2 for dose adjustment), and instructed to reduce their caloric intake by 500kcal/day.

*Down Sides:* Most people have some degree of dry mouth with this medication (salivary gland activity decreased due to sympathetic nervous system activation). Insomnia and constipation are also common (\~30%).

*Scary:* If you have a known history of substance use disorder, particularly with amphetamines, this medication is not for you. Given there is a theoretical risk of increased blood pressure, its not the first medication to prescribe for patients with history of arrhythmia.

**Topiramate (Topamax, Qsymia)**

*How it works:* See above for more information on Qsymia combination. Topiramate's mechanism for causing weight loss is similar to Phentermine in that it acts on GABA receptors to decrease appetite. In and of itself, it doesn't change your metabolism. It is a tool to make it easier to eat at a caloric deficit.

On Topiramate alone, patients lost approximately [3.9% within 3 months and 7.3% at 1 year](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0920121111001343?casa_token=uwL8CFLzP6oAAAAA:-I0g9nG3tETycjtWrH7nkEXHq0RTBcmnVmb_YmRPHnHWBTGbW5UNbRocRp4tIBRZePLtFCmb0w), in patients taking the medication for epilepsy. Given its risk of kidney stones, very important to drink lots and lots of water on this medication!

Good news is, it is generic and pretty cheap (\~$25/month, depending on your pharmacy/dosage)

*Down Sides*: Pins and needles tingling sensation (mostly in toes, sometimes other areas as well) (\~30%), Taste changes (8-15% depending on dosage), fatigue. Not recommended as first medication for those with history of kidney stones, or epilepsy. Can't stop taking abruptly, as it can cause seizures.

*Scary:* Hair loss (alopecia) in about 1-4%. Memory change/confusion usually described as ""brain fog""‚Äì not recommended for elderly, also rare.

**Bupropion (Wellbutrin, Contrave (combo with Naltrexone))**

*How it works:* Bupropion was developed as an antidepressant. Your brain naturally releases Norepinephrine and Dopamine to send signals shooting down your neurons. After a while, the hormones are taken back up to be released next time. This medication blocks re-uptake, allowing signaling to continue. Low levels of dopamine have been associated with increased hunger, so by increasing dopamine signaling, you will have less appetite/cravings. Again, this doesn't inherently increase metabolism, it just decreases appetite and improves mood for those who are struggling with both weight and depression. Good news is its also pretty cheap! (generic $\~15/month)

[In this trial of obese patients:](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1038/oby.2002.86)placebo group lost 5%, bupropion group lost 7.2-10.1% over 24 weeks (based on dosage). Placebo group had an intro dietician visit and was provided a meal plan that recommended Slim Fast for 24 weeks, and 1 slim fast per day for the last 24 weeks (was not provided to patients, just recommended).

[In this trial of obese patients with depression](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1038/oby.2002.142), patients lost 4.6% on bupropion vs 1.8% placebo (500kcal deficit) over 26 weeks. They also had <=50% depressive symptoms on medication.

*Down Sides:* Most common side effects reported [between 11-17% are dry mouth, headache, nausea, insomnia (need to take in AM!) constipation, dizziness.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1163271/pdf/i1523-5998-7-3-106.pdf)

*Scary:* 0.4% of patients will have seizures on this medication at doses over 300XR, and rates increase with higher doses above this- this is still quite rare.

**Naltrexone (Contrave, ReVia, Vitrol)**

*How it works:* Naltrexone was originally created for substance use disorder, as it is an opioid receptor antagonist. However, it is now broadly used for other use disorders (tobacco, alcohol, binge eating disorder) as its been shown to decrease cravings overall in your brain's reward pathway. Its pretty cheap when prescribed alone as a generic, but Contrave combo is branded + expensive. You can get naltrexone/bupropion individually as generics for less.

There isn't much benefit when given alone, so its primarily prescribed with Bupropion (either as Contrave combo or both pills as generics).

[Contrave: the combo of naltrexone/bupropion](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3138366/) has been studied in a few trials to cause between 6.7-8.1% weight loss (1.8% placebo- mild hypocaloric diet and exercise), and in another trial 11.5% (7.3% placebo, with intense hypocaloric diet/exercise regimen).

*Down Sides:* Most commonly reported side effect is [nausea (\~30%)](https://www.aafp.org/afp/2015/0415/p554.html) with headache, constipation in the \~10%

*Scary:* If you are concurrently using opioids, this will put you into withdrawal and can lead to opioid withdrawal symptoms. It should not be used in patients with seizure disorder due to a risk of increasing seizures.

**Orlistat (Alli, Xenical)**

*How it works*: Orlistat was made for weight loss: it directly works on your pancreatic lipase cells to literally block the breakdown and thus absorption of fats in your diet. Sounds like a miracle right? Unfortunately, it blocks ALL fats, and has multiple times/day dosing.

Blocking all fats means there is a risk of vitamin deficiencies when taken long term, or in those already deficient (vitamin D, E, A, K). It also means many patients struggle with the very common side effects of fats in their stool/flatulence, foul smelling gas, etc. [Patients lost about 5.17% vs 2.75% with placebo](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2012/020766s029lbl.pdf).

*Down Sides:* Taken 120mg three times per day. Expensive, but over the counter (Alli) \~$150/month.

*Scary:* Due to its mechanism on fats, it can lead to [increase risk of gallstones.](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2012/020766s029lbl.pdf)

**Metformin**

How it works: Metformin is primarily used as a mainstay treatment for T2DM. It has been shown to help some patients lose weight as well, although mostly PCOS patients.[Studies really vary on this,](https://journals.lww.com/co-endocrinology/fulltext/2014/10000/effects_of_metformin_on_weight_loss__potential.3.aspx?casa_token=y5Gy9oSgdmgAAAAA:3g0mbPKkeTgsx_hKQGyTT4NykugUBjbvajTEB2zuORDYaWtFgQeqMKs_DFsW_mQDSkPECdlBmsFhnaaSCvydOjbX)but most suggest modest weight loss of around 2.9kg vs 0.8kg placebo (minimal intervention). However, this weight loss is sustained long term, and the medication has other benefits on preventing progression of prediabetes -> diabetes, and controlling A1C.

Down Sides: Most patients complain of [GI distress](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2017/020357s037s039,021202s021s023lbl.pdf) (nausea, vomitting, diarrhea, flatulence) \~20-40%.

Scary: Very rare, but some cases of lactic acidosis (kidney problem).

**Plenity (cellulose and citric acid combo) aka Gelesis100**

*How it works:* This is a new medication that actually went through something tricky with FDA-cleared vs FDA-approved. Because it was approved as a ""medical device"" rather than a prescription medication, its approval process was slightly different.

You know that feeling when you've eaten a large salad and your stomach feels full from the sheer volume of leafy greens you ate? That feeling is from cellulose in leafy greens that is indigestible, but makes you feel very full. That's what this is trying to mimic, its a cellulose/citric acid pill that expands with water in your stomach. You take this pill

There's really only 1 study that's been done on this, funded by Roman (you might know them as the ED company) [the GLOW Trial](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/oby.22347) which showed patients lost 6.4% vs 4.4% for placebo (a difference of only 2.2%) over 24 weeks. Its 3 2.25g capsules (big pills!) taken with 500mL water (2 cups of water) 20-30 minutes before dinner. These pills expand with water and make you feel full at meal times so you eat less.

*Down Sides:* Poor evidence it really works, about $100/month. [Given that just 500ml water at meal times has been shown to decrease caloric consumption by almost 200kcal/day](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1038/oby.2009.235) and the same weight reduction, doesn't really have good data to support the medication!

*Scary:* Do not take this if you have had vertical sleeve gastrectomy, or at least talk to your PCP first! You have a smaller stomach after surgery, and the expanding gel pills could cause perforation/expansion.

**NOW, the other topic: Weight loss Supplements.**

Phen-Q: Primarily a caffeine pill, with B3 and capsicum. No clinical studies showing it helps lose weight.

Waist Trainers: Make your stomach sweat. They're marketted as a way to make your stomach lose water weight/slim. However, there's no evidence they do that, and [they actually decrease your lung function](http://rc.rcjournal.com/content/63/Suppl_10/3012838.short).

FitTeas/laxative tea: These are usually Senna based teas, a common herb-based laxative. Not only are they overpriced, but chronic senna use leads to [melanosis coli!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanosis_coli) Also scary, [chronic use can lead to cyclic edema‚Äì ie. this case](https://www.spmi.pt/revista/vol17/eng_vol17_n2_2010_081_084.pdf).

B12/Lipotropic shots: No evidence it helps with weight loss unless you have a clinical lab finding showing deficiency. Even then, oral therapy is usually enough. For patients who have had gastric bypass, [deficiency is common and should be checked on labs BEFORE starting therapy.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1550728913001664)",59,10,2022-04-15T00:18:29,WeightLossAdvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/u3ofcb/a_comprehensive_guide_to_prescription_weight/,1.0,True,/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/u3ofcb/a_comprehensive_guide_to_prescription_weight/

13e1qc5,TheRealDingdork,Any ideas?,"Hey I (f17) have struggled with my weight for a long time. I was always a heavy kid. It was never overly concerning to my pediatrician since I had a lot of health issues so my blood work was tested frequently and other than slightly high cholesterol (which is genetic and I work on) I had no other problems associated with obesity. However now I'm around 230-240lbs and may need surgery. The surgeon won't do it if I'm above 200 but here's the thing. I've never really lost weight. I have tried for years. It was so unhealthy at certain points that my mother would ""threaten"" with taking me to the hospital if I didn't eat. But even then I barely shed a pound. I've seen two nutritionists I've done multitudes of diets on my own and with them and recently my mom has helped manage my food with calorie counting so I didn't have to deal with it. I ate around 1500 calories and that felt good I was a little hungry sometimes but not hangry. I didn't lose practically anything. So we dropped it to 1200 and I'm hungry and tired and still not losing a blessed thing. I go on walks where I can it's difficult to manage exercise with my sickness but I do it because I might not be able to feel better if I don't lose 40 pounds. Does anyone have any ideas as to why I might not be losing weight? The only thing I can think of is that there is something wrong with my body medically. Neither nutritionist figured it out. 

I'm not someone to try diets for a few days and say they don't work. I've been struggling with my weight since I was like 10. I would stick diets out for several months before saying they don't work. Except for this calorie counting but that is partially because I really need to lose weight fast it's not a lifestyle thing.

Also, I have since worked on my issues with food. Although the second nutritionist never helped me lose weight she helped me eat to feel healthy and be comfortable in my own skin and not burst into tears in a candy store  If it weren't for this surgery I wouldnt be looking to lose weight. I'm happy to say it's not an appearance thing anymore Even if this whole mess is dredging up some less than pleasant memories.",1,3,2023-05-11T01:39:19,WeightLossAdvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/13e1qc5/any_ideas/,0.67,True,/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/13e1qc5/any_ideas/

107wuex,loreliephasis,My Prolon fast review- 2 weeks later,"If you haven't heard of the Prolon Fasting product, it's a 1 day or 5 day fasting mimicking product that can set you into ketosis or just reset you into healthier habits. The kit comes with bars, soups, teas and a meal plan. My journey with the fast went as follows, 

Day 1- Challenging but not as bad as I thought 
Day 2- Much easier
Day 3- Very difficult especially toward the end of the day because I'm a night snacker
Day 4- Almost caved, very irritable. Probably would not have been able to do it if there were more food temptation around. 
Day 5- Pushed through but stayed up past midnight to have my favorite foods and break the fast. 

My history with fasting is interesting because I actually used to fast for religious reasons very regularly. Water only fasts, partial fasts, 3-7 day long fasts with regular excercise and food temptation all around and was very disciplined. I haven't fasted this way in over 12 years though so I wasnt sure how my mind and body would respond. I was impressed how well I did though and would definitely do again. At the end of it I lost about 2.5 pounds which was a bit disappointing because I had heard of people losing a lot more during the fast. 

After the fast-

I'm 2 weeks out from the fast and I'm seeing very positive side effects from it. I've noticed that while I do get hungry in between meals, I'm not as sensitive to my hunger as I was before and I don't rush to satisfy my hunger or binge. 

I'm very comfortable counting my calories and staying within my calorie limit now whereas before, I consistently went over my calorie limit and gave up on a diet days on every attempt. 

I'm comfortable going to bed hungry and don't feel the need to satisfy every craving. 

My sugar cravings have dramatically reduced and my appetite for better options have increased. 

I'm eating out less and cooking at home more and being more mindful of what's going in my food. 

Overall I would say prolon definitely got my mind out of a bad place with food and I would recommend it to anyone who has a rough relationship with food. Even though the weight loss isn't what I hoped for, there are other great side effects.",17,3,2023-01-10T07:09:09,WeightLossAdvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/107wuex/my_prolon_fast_review_2_weeks_later/,0.95,True,/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/107wuex/my_prolon_fast_review_2_weeks_later/

11k8bmg,MeByTheSea_16,What‚Äôs been working for me: 27lbs down,"32F here. I am 5‚Äô4‚Äù. At my highest weight last year, I was 185lbs. After getting on the generic Nuvaring birth control in July of 22, I lost 10lbs over the next few months because the BC somehow helped with appetite control- I felt fuller faster and also was sensitive to strong smells, so I stayed away from junk food for a while. I decided to keep the good habits going and take advantage of this accidental head start. 


In November, our Dr told my husband that his blood pressure and cholesterol was through the roof, so I began making really clean meals to get his stuff under control. For once, he‚Äôs kept up with my clean meals and isn‚Äôt bringing junk into the house and I‚Äôm able to stick to eating clean without his pasta and chips tempting me. I did ask the Dr about semaglutide but he said it was so hard/expensive to find that I should try losing weight naturally first, and include fasting into my regimen. I don‚Äôt think I even need semaglutide now! 

In November, I was 175lbs. Today, I am 158lbs. In January, I got a meal prep recipe book called ‚ÄúCook Once, Eat All Week‚Äù by Cassy Joy Garcia. I follow the meal preps exactly. The max calories for a usual meal in the book is 600-700, very rarely over that. 


In January, we also rented a Peloton bike for $90/mo which includes the $44/mo app that has all the classes: cycling, boot camp, yoga, Pilates, etc. The bike was a GAME CHANGER! I started off with 10min low impact rides and am now up to 30min HIITs and strength classes. Also, you have the option to purchase it at the end of 12mo which we will definitely do! I workout 3+ days per week now and that was huge, my body dropped a ton of weight fast!


Lastly, the biggest item that‚Äôs made a difference has been fasting and eating one (huge & healthy) meal per day on fasting days. I try to fast 1-3x/week. On fasting weeks, I am dropping at least 1lb/week, if not 2lbs sometimes. 


Hope this helps someone. I would love to hear anyone‚Äôs advice on what‚Äôs been working for you as well.",2,0,2023-03-06T23:44:50,WeightLossAdvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/11k8bmg/whats_been_working_for_me_27lbs_down/,1.0,True,/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/11k8bmg/whats_been_working_for_me_27lbs_down/

1e3ltu9,Baz2dabone,Ozempic,"So I just want to post about this because I‚Äôve been trying to lose weight for YEARS. Since I was in college I‚Äôve wanted to lose weight. I think I do have an unhealthy relationship with food and weight loss , but I‚Äôve never seen or been diagnosed with anything. This is going to be controversial but I did start taking ozempic over a year ago. I wasn‚Äôt sure if I was going to say anything to anyone but wanted people to know that this is the only thing that has helped me. Not only did it stop my binge eating habits, but it has given me what ‚Äúnormal‚Äù portions are. I was a binge eater, and nothing stopped me. Ozempic has given me that opportunity to ‚Äúfeel full‚Äù but also not crave food like I used to. I‚Äôve been off it now for 4 months, and I still don‚Äôt crave or binge eat. I hope people know that , yes ozempic does aid in weight loss, but for me it also helped with overeating and being able to form new habits. I know it‚Äôs controversial but it‚Äôs been the best thing for me. You can get it from a wellness center for a couple hundred dollars a month. My only advice though is take full advantage of how it makes you feel (aka eating less so start meal prepping so it becomes habit when you get off, and working out so it also becomes habit). I know this feels like cheating for some people but sometimes working smarter not harder can help.

1cyxylc,staysafetraveler,Wife trying to lose weight while fighting the urge to use ozempic ,"This one is lengthy, but....

I've been with my wife for a few years now, everything is great, i love her to death. However, over the last year and a half or so, she has put on over 30lbs. Personally, it doesn't bother me, but the last three months she's started to try to lose weight and get back to a weight she was at before. I've also been trying to shed a few pounds myself, so I thought this would be a fun goal to have where we can each support each other.

We both know how to lose weight and I feel i've done well in both diet & exercise. Prior to meeting my wife, I actually had just lost about 45lbs myself, so I really mean it when i tell her that i've been in her shoes.

She initially lost about 5-7lbs, but for the last month or so has basically stalled on weight. The last couple of weeks in particular have been especially tough for her and i can see her frustration. I tell her all the time, i love her no matter what. Where i'm starting to get concerned is she seems to be putting a lot of her self worth and value on her weight. I try to tell her to not try to do that (as i know, easier said that done). I'm definitely a bit more of a positive person, so i try to keep the positive mindset with us. ie ""let's keep going"" ""i know it's tough, but we're doing this together"" etc. and when she has a tough week i try to get her on focusing on what is in front of her by saying things like: ""well it's in the past, let's try to get on track today/this week"" and that's usually met with her telling me she's ""tried everything and is sick of being unhappy with her body""

I feel like i know where she is struggling:

Diet: I know you can lose weight without doing this, but she doesn't really track her food. She basically eyeballs all of her food and doesn't particularly track/weight anything. which is fine, but can be tough to gauge how much she may be eating. I try to set the example of portioning/weighing things out in front of her since that is what i'm doing. She doesn't really track anything and she also snacks a lot. She also sometimes will skip means and i feel this compounds because when she does eat she eats more than what she would have had she not skipped a meal. To be clear, i'm not talking intermittent fasting, i mean like she'll have breakfast, get ""too busy"" and not eat until 6pm. And we do a fair alloy t of meal pre

Stress: She is constantly stressed, a majority of the time by her own doing. I joke with her that she has a stress addiction. She does a good job of not being stressed at/with her job. but everything outside of work, i feel like she finds ways to be stressed. Can never go to a party or function without cooking and bringing food for example even when prompted not to. When we have a night to ourselves, the day is usually filled with being stressed. For example, if we're going to a baseball game or something at night, the whole day prior is filled helping her family or friends or just nonstop cleaning the house. Do we have a free weekend? she invites family over for dinner, which means frantically deep cleaning the house = more stress. Need her to see that it's okay to put herself first. And I try to help her as much as I can by taking any of her tasks/errands off her hands

Exercise: Another issue is, she is inconsistent with the gym. I know with work, it can be tough, but i'm always willing to go with her (even if it means going twice in a day for me). and every time i go, i offer if she wants to join. I tell her, even a 20 minute workout is better than nothing, but she seems to have an ""all or nothing"" mentality with the gym. Working out/gym is the first thing dropped anytime she is stressed. i've mentioned it can be an stress reliever as well. I also offer simply going on some walks with me, which she only accepts about half of the time. 

Ozempic: The last issue, is both one of her close friends and another co-worker friend of hers are both currently losing a lot of weight by using ozempic. Initially, my wife was very against it, but with her seeing others lose weight with it, she says things such as ""if in a few months i'm at the same weight, i'm going on ozempic"" I just fear that may be a bit of the easy way out, not to mention any of the potential side effects. she's had health issues in the past, and i fear some of those may come back using ozempic. or she'll lose weight, but have other body issues she's unhappy with. I know she can do whatever she wants with her body, but i just don't feel the effort has been all the way there so she shouldn't go down that path. And this is the area that I don't know what she's going through, when i lost weight, there wasn't a bunch of people around me using ozempic.



Looking for any advice i can get. if you feel i'm doing something wrong please tell me. If you think I should just be more direct and tell her all the areas i think she can improve on, i'm open to hearing that too. If any of you have gone through this, any cool challenges or anything fun ways to make losing weight more enjoyable or attainable. 

How do i help her to stop talking poorly about herself and looking down on herself for her weight?

Truly any feedback on what to do is helpful.

tldr: wife wants to lose weight, but she's not putting herself in best position, want her to avoid ozempic and she puts too much of her self worth on her weight even though i tell her i love her no matter what she looks like, i love her for who she is",3,83,2024-05-23T22:37:09,WeightLossAdvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/1cyxylc/wife_trying_to_lose_weight_while_fighting_the/,0.54,True,/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/1cyxylc/wife_trying_to_lose_weight_while_fighting_the/

1gbdpmr,Top-Dirt5239,Will Ozempic help me or will I just be wasting money I don't having by buying it?,"Long post ahead!

I (22F) have a food problem I'm coming to terms with. I won't diagnose myself but I've had eating issues for about six years now - severe self hatred after eating, compulsive binge eating, eating past fullness to the point of pain, eating my emotions etc. You get the point. But it got really serious in the past four years.

I could go weeks/months okay in my body but then there'd be times I was viscerally aware of my own heaviness as soon as I'd even drink water. It'd get so bad I would go almost a week without eating, give up and eat a small meal, then repeat. Typically, it'd last like two weeks? I'd lose enough weight to ease my mind, maybe 5 or 6kg, then I'd go back to eating normally and inevitably gain it back. My mind operates towards food in a very black or white spectrum. It's either I eat or I don't. The minute I eat a proper meal, the gateway opens for a binge and I've had nights where I can't sleep not because I'm hungry but because I'm waiting for my roommates to fall asleep so I can sneak in a meal, because I'm too ashamed to let them see me eat after they've already seen me eat three times that day. Basically, I can't portion control. My food noise is too much. From the moment I wake up, I'm thinking about what to eat. I spend the whole day craving foods I haven't eaten in a while. I go to sleep thinking about what I'm going to eat the next day and if I have any snacks I can munch on before I turn in for the night.

Then, it got really bad around the three year mark, because I couldn't stand the heaviness in my stomach whenever I'd eat, and I started throwing up. I'd spent 20 to 40 minutes making myself vomit till my stomach hurt whenever I thought I'd eaten too much, even if I didn't do it immediately. Around this time, I started fasting as well. All this is the backstory to my current situation; I'm getting to that point where I might start making myself throw up again. I've been feeling it come on for about twelve days now, and I've been gaining weight because I can't make myself stop eating. It doesn't help that both my parents are hot on my neck to lose weight because I'm grossly overweight. I don't want to go that bad again, as I have severely damaged teeth from several months of consistently flooding my mouth with stomach acid. Recently, I've had an opportunity to go on Ozempic, but I can't afford it without touching my savings of 5+ years. My country's currency is shit, so I'll give the numbers in both my currency and dollars. A month's worth of Ozempic from the supplier I'm speaking with is about 380,000 (251\~ dollars) and my life savings is 700,000 (425\~)

Would I be stupid to buy a month's worth of Ozempic right now? Although I've just graduated college, I live with my parents currently and make 83,000 (51\~ dollars) from a temporary job at the moment. I'm 5'3 and BMI 44 which is why I'm seriously considering taking this risk even though I know it'll be quite a hit to my savings.

I don't expect Ozempic to be some magic wand that gets rid of my issues, but I do think losing some weight would be in my best interests both physically and mentally.",4,38,2024-10-25T02:49:48,WeightLossAdvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/1gbdpmr/will_ozempic_help_me_or_will_i_just_be_wasting/,0.67,True,/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/1gbdpmr/will_ozempic_help_me_or_will_i_just_be_wasting/
1g60yvl,Hey_it_is_mi,Self discipline vs Ozempic,I guess in reality the reason why people go on Ozempic is because they lack the discipline from not over eating.. (not including people with medical problems that make you gain weight ) I'm coming to a point where I really wish I could take it but obviously that's the easy way out right? I haven't been consistent with my eating or my exercising so I know why my weight is staying the same... I have extreme anxiety and hypochondria so there's no way I will be able to take this..

1fpmt0g,KuraBELL,Not losing on Ozempic ,"Yes I know it's not a magic drug! But! The weight isn't going down. I do feel a difference. I don't feel starving all the damn time! Before it was painful how hungey I was. Every day my body was telling me I was starving and the ozempic has been like an awakening! For the hunger at least. Other than that my weight has only shifted back and forth like 5 pounds. It keeps going up and down 5 lbs, that's it.

I'm a big girl 315, used to be 340. I got down that weight before the ozempic. I was starving myself, not good I know. 

I'm a CNA so I'm always on my feet and lifting patients. So I know it's not a lake of exercise. I drink a shit ton of water (this was also before the ozempic)

So much water to the point that I DRIP sweat like a danm fountain at work! And then I crave water so badly I chug it! And feel it immediately turn into sweat that again drips down my face! Like for real. It's so bad. My patients have told me to wear a sweatband to work! Doctor said all my blood work is fine, no thyroid problem. Slightly high blood sugar.

But back to what I was saying. Other than the decrease in the hunger pains, I haven't noticed a whole lot else. Some foods I don't want as much anymore. I'm glad for that. I'm not always hungry so I'm trying to force myself to drink protein drinks. I think it may be of lack of that. I'm not eating enough. Truth be told. Long history of starving myself trying to break out of it. 

I wish that ozempic wasn't a stigma and that we could look at it as something that's helpful and I hope it will help me. So far it has helped in some ways. I'm still on the .25 dose and I'm about to start my dose increase in a week or so. 

I started and stopped the medicine before so I have never done a dose increase just yet. I'm hoping maybe the next phase will help bring out some more benefits. For those that have been on ozempic. Have you had a similar journey? Was this something that you went through? Does it get better? I know it's not a lack of trying. I'm constantly on my feet and working everyday. Now. Whether people want to argue that's a workout or not. I don't care. At my current weight It feels like a workout because yes, it's very physically strenuous! I'm wondering if maybe I'm just holding on to a lot of water initially and my body hasn't breaking out of that yet. But I've been on the ozempic for almost 4 weeks And I just keep going back and forth between those 5 lb.

1bh7ejl,Safe-Parsley3184,Ozempic Shame ,"If you can, I‚Äôd like as little judgement as possible when interacting with this post. Please be kind. Also kind of a long read and maybe triggering. 

I(21f) have obsessed over my weight for most of my life. It started at 7, maybe 8 years old and my earliest, most emotionally charged memories is of older adults criticising my looks. These people weren‚Äôt my family, my family has always been kind, but it still had a a massive impact.
So naturally, the desire to be skinny is imbedded within me. It makes up a huge, silent part of who I am.

At my most active: walking to and from school, playing 2 sports, multiple extra-curriculars, trying to keep portions at bay, I was still fat. About 72kg on a 165cm frame. 

I always noticed other people‚Äôs interactions with food. So calm and relaxed. Desiring something sometimes, chaotic at times but ultimately intuitive. I, on the other hand, always feel‚Ä¶ intense when it comes to food. When I engage with food it‚Äôs intense. I want to involve food with everything; Emotions, boredom, studying, relaxing. And when I‚Äôm not engaging with food I‚Äôm always thinking about it. It‚Äôs always buzzing in the background. Always. 

What‚Äôs embarrassing is that I‚Äôve always wanted to be anorexic. It seemed like the better, more appropriate eating disorder to have. (P.s. I don‚Äôt want to be told to go to therapy, I‚Äôve already tried all of that. I I don‚Äôt want to be told to go to therapy, I‚Äôve already tried all of that.) When I was younger, I would listen to any tip that I could find, from the healthiest to the most disordered but my desire for food would trump all, no matter what, I would always stay fat. 

I‚Äôm now 85kg on a 165cm frame. BMI = >30. I know that extreme restricting doesn‚Äôt work so I‚Äôm currently in a reasonable calorie deficit (my umpteenth attempt at losing weight this way). 1300 - 1600 calories per day, some days lower, some higher. Lifting heavy in the gym for muscle. An hours walk everyday and some additional cardio on other days per week. Volume eating. Meal prepping. 6-8 hours of sleep every night‚Äî yet the buzzing persists. When I wake up, when I go to bed, while I eat, bathe, everything. 

It‚Äôs taking up all my energy, both conscious and unconscious, to keep up with losing weight. I worry that even if I reach my goal weight, my entire life will be spent ruminating, obsessing and living life surrounding my weight.

I got diagnosed with ADHD a year ago and tried a few stimulant medications. They didn‚Äôt work for me in the long term but once side-effect I did notice was the buzzing quiet. It was the most bizarre I got diagnosed with ADHD a year ago and tried a few stimulant medications. They didn‚Äôt work for me in the long term but one side-effect I did notice was the buzzing going quiet. It was the most bizarre satisfying things I‚Äôve ever felt. 

I see a lot of people who‚Äôve gone on Wegovy or ozempic, talking about ‚Äúthe quiet‚Äù ‚Äî The food noise  finally disappearing. I‚Äôm well aware of shortages in medication for people with diabetes and would never use it while this occurs, but I‚Äôve been thinking about the future when stock for people with diabetes and for people who need to lose weight is sufficient and I think I want to get on the medication for weight loss. 
For some reason though, this makes me feel extremely shameful and guilty and those feelings make me angry because why do I feel that way?

Why do I feel shame for wanting silence? 
Why do I feel like I‚Äôm cheating or lazy for desiring a less tumultuous relationship with my food? 
Why do I feel guilty for wanting to be skinny? 

I‚Äôm very confused and conflicted about my feelings and honestly just wanted to vent and see if anyone relates and could possibly shed light on why I am thinking this way.

1d6qhzx,KMC228,Tried Ozempic and Monjauro and lost zero pounds ,"I am beginning to feel like a freak of nature when it comes to weight gain and inability to lose weight. I am a 51 year old female who is very active. I work out at a gym 3 days a week and walk an average of 10,000 steps a day. I also swim, go for bike rides, lift weights at home, and am always on the go. I do have a desk job, but I get up at least every hour to walk around or walk the stairs. 

Since turning 50 I‚Äôve gained about 15 pounds that I simply can‚Äôt lose. I don‚Äôt drink alcohol, I drink a ton of water, and about 8 months ago I cut way back on sugar and carbs. I‚Äôve added a lot of lean protein to my diet. Didn‚Äôt lose a pound. I got so frustrated that I tried Ozempic and Monjaiuro for 6 weeks each and didn‚Äôt lose ONE pound on either drug. I‚Äôm currently about 20 pounds overweight and other than starving myself, I‚Äôm at a loss. 

I‚Äôm not in menopause and still get my period. Most of the weight has settled in my stomach and back. I‚Äôm so frustrated that I want to cry almost daily. We even had a walking contest at work and I came in 3rd place with an average of 13,000 steps a day over 3 months. I mean, WTF?

Growing up I was quite active but still on the bigger side but due to school I ended up way more sedentary and I‚Äôm starting to get a bit worried about my health. I‚Äôve been trying to lose weight for so long but I really cannot I‚Äôve tried being more active by going to the gym for over a year - nothing. I‚Äôve completely changed my diet aka limiting fast food and incorporating more veg to make up a big portion of my plate - nothing. I‚Äôve even done extreme calorie counting but that was hard to keep up long term. I know there is very likely so hormonal issues (I have most signs of PCOS) that are affecting my lack of weight loss too.

But I recently realised I‚Äôm struggling with control and food noise. For example a week ago I made some low calorie lasagna and in the end I had 5 portions when put containers. Naturally I had 1 and left the other 4 out to cool while I ate. As soon as I finished my 1st bowl all I could think about was having more. Not cause I was particularly hungry (there was salad and 2 slices of garlic bread alongside it)  but because I just wanted to taste it again. I quite literally couldn‚Äôt focus on anything even went on a walk to distract myself. It started as a small bite and in the end I had 2 portions of lasagna instead of one. 

I know things containing GLP1 are good for lessening food noise but I‚Äôm a student and literally can‚Äôt afford it.

1bnzotu,ConsequenceBetter878,I only have a couple of months to lose weight before they put me on Ozempic,"So, for context, the past 5 months (almost 6), I've been working with medical professionals to lose weight. I've tracked all my calories (I've been below 1700 everyday minus like 7), I'm eating the right amount of fiber and protein, I've been working out a minimum of 30 minutes every day, daily measurements, I've been drinking roughly 100 oz of water, etc.. I've been doing all of this under medical supervision and with professional help, and I haven't lost a pound.

Due to a combination of hormonal issues, digestive issues, and several different medications, I've been unable to lose weight. I tried getting off my medication, but I felt like I was going crazy and had to get back on it (I have some pretty severe mental health issues and need to be on meds, but I did try). 

My doctor just started the process of getting me on a GLP-1 medication like Ozempic. My labs came back pre-diabetic, and I refuse to let it get any worse (I wasn't pre-diabetic a year and a half ago, but I got pregnant and put on a pretty substantial amount of weight). I will get on Ozempic I if nothing else works, but I really don't want to. I've always suffered for pretty bad digestive issues, and I fear some of the side effects of GLP-1 medication will just make my day to day hellish. As I said, though, I do not want to become diabetic and Ozempic would be temporary because my weight does remain pretty stable (I haven't lost anything, but I haven't gained anything). I'm just desperate at this point to lose the weight to get healthy. 

Does anyone have any advice or ideas? I've tried Alli, but it also makes my digestive issues worse. I don't want to do any fad diets. I have a month or 2 based on my insurance and the shortages to try to do this naturally. I'm open to answering any questions. I just want to see if there is anything I can do that my doctor hasn't suggested already.",5,9,2024-03-26T10:32:20,WeightLossAdvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/1bnzotu/i_only_have_a_couple_of_months_to_lose_weight/,0.69,True,/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/1bnzotu/i_only_have_a_couple_of_months_to_lose_weight/

18qabdr,ImpressiveDog2039,My mom wants to start taking Ozempic,"(English is not my first language)

  
My mother recently told me that she wanted to start taking Ozempic to help her lose weight significantly. She has always suffered from an eating disorder: hyperphagia. Although she has been free of binge eating for about 3 years, she has never actually consulted a specialist for the disorder. She seems to say that the disorder is ""under control"".

  
She has low self-esteem and makes negative comments about her body. She hates shopping and dressing, finding that clothes don't fit well and that plus sizes are never well suited to large bodies.

  
She told me that she had called a clinic to get Ozempic and that they had refused. In my opinion, she should be followed by a psychologist specializing in eating disorders. She also mentioned that physical activity had had no effect on her physique and that she hadn't seen any weight loss, so she'd given up her daily walk. She has a fairly sedentary lifestyle. As for her diet, she cooks a lot, and very well-balanced meals. On the other hand, she often buys chips, sweets and chocolate.

  
She says that Ozempic would enable her to reach a healthy weight that would allow her to adopt good habits. What should I do? What do I say to dissuade her from taking Ozempic?",6,10,2023-12-25T08:52:40,WeightLossAdvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/18qabdr/my_mom_wants_to_start_taking_ozempic/,0.62,True,/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/18qabdr/my_mom_wants_to_start_taking_ozempic/

However, he's just now been approved to start Ozempic to help control his blood sugar and likely hello him lose alot is weight since it's going to shrink his stomach. He can't wait.

panmuo,doker0,"Ozempic is insane! Gave me hope! No sorry, proved my hopes. My dream is coming true","I came here just to tell you about it. I straggled with diabetes 2 and constantly raising weight throughout years even on metformin. At one point I even had my sugar levels perfect again but the weight just kept on coming back.

Then I've read about Saxenda and Ozempic. At this point I was already on diet and came down from 127kg to 124.5kg but couldn't move any lower.

My minimum was always 112kg and I felt like starved and nervous and this is when I always broke the diet.

I started taking Saxenda, then moved to Ozempic for convenience. I've begun March 1st with 124.5kg. In the first 3 months I came down to 115kg, today (August 24th) I checked and it's 105kg.

I lost 16% of my mass without any particular diet, exercise, no hunger or feeling cold.I lost some apatite for alcohol, too, though I still drink when I want and still lose weight.

I do look kind of not well rested but it is obvious when I burn calories from old fat with all these embedded toxins.

My life has changed. My small kids grow and gain weight as much as I'm losing it so I can still carry both of them around like for free, like I'd carried only one of them, because I lost as much as 1 total kid plus how much the other gained in that time.

I feel attractive again.

1dwatyb,always_more_problems,How to begin combating the obesity death spiral?,"I (M, 23, 5'10"", 278 lbs) have had an intervention from family members about my obesity. This isn't the first time, but this is the one that stuck with me the hardest. 

Multiple times they've come to me about my weight and I've always found some nonsense excuse, or justified my actions using my emotions, or saying I'm just losing it slowly, or something along those lines. The nature of this talk was different, though, in that there were 2 key points made to me.

1. My weight is a burden. Physically on myself, but in a metaphorical sense to my loved ones. It was pointed out that if I suffered from a heart attack or a stroke, my family members would not be physically able to lift me to help. Were something like that to happen, even the trained paramedics they call would be hindered, and may not be able to get me to the ER in time. I am, in essence, a ticking time bomb of a medical emergency. My blood pressure is already higher than it should be, so I guess the fuse has already been lit.

2. I am ignorant to how others view my weight (and things associated with it, such as eating habits). Yesterday was July 4th, and we were invited to a family friend's place for lunch. I hadn't realized at the time, but I ate more than other people around me even when I thought I was cutting down. A family member made the point (which I agree with) that even if the people around you care for you and are your friends/ family, there is a measure of apprehension and disbelief others feel when they see a fat person take so much food. There is a judgment made even if it's not intentional. It's embarrassing, frankly, for me but doubly for them.

I love my family. My parents have worked hard to give me a happy life, and my siblings are always pushing themselves to be better people. I'm proud to call myself a member of their family, but that pride has turned to shame; In my selfish actions and ignorant gluttony, I have hurt them in ways I have been blind to. I don't want to continue freaking them out about if/when I'll drop. I don't want to make them feel embarrassed of/ for and regret inviting me to places. I don't want to continue down this path, but I feel lost. I don't know where to make a meaningful start, without relapsing. 

I think this is the heaviest my fat has felt, even if I weighed more in the past.",217,122,2024-07-06T04:20:22,WeightLossAdvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/1dwatyb/how_to_begin_combating_the_obesity_death_spiral/,0.98,True,/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/1dwatyb/how_to_begin_combating_the_obesity_death_spiral/
1e9azm0,fr33dom35,What are ways to make eating at a caloric deficit easier?,"Obviously eating at a caloric deficit is no fun. If it were we wouldn't be fat

But how do you make it not suck as bad?

Personally here are things that help me

-Limiting carbs, eating more protein and fat to feel full for longer. If I eat ice cream I just want more ice cream 45 minutes later and I'm not losing any weight that day

-Skipping breakfast. I'm naturally not super hungry in the morning

-Drinking black coffee/espresso earlier in the day as an appetite suppressant 

-Saving more of my caloric intake for the end of the day, when I'm likely to have less self control and otherwise struggle going to bed hungry 

Everyone's different though. What works for you?

1jlmvra,Entire-Reference-976,The One Thing That Finally Helped Me Lose Weight (And It Wasn‚Äôt What I Expected),"Hey everyone!

I wanted to share something that completely changed my weight loss journey‚Äîbecause it wasn‚Äôt the gym, a new diet, or even counting calories. It was THIS.

I spent YEARS trying every method out there‚Äîlow carb, fasting, HIIT workouts, even running (which I absolutely hated). Nothing ever stuck. I‚Äôd lose 5 lbs, gain 10, and repeat the cycle endlessly.

Then, one small change flipped the switch.   
**I started tracking my steps.**   
That‚Äôs it. I told myself, ‚ÄúJust hit 5,000 a day.‚Äù No crazy workouts. No meal plans. Just get up and move.

Something wild happened. I started losing weight without even trying. I naturally ate a little less because I was focusing on movement instead of obsessing over food. My energy improved. 5,000 steps turned into 8,000. Then 10,000. Then I wanted to lift weights. Then I wanted to eat better. And here I am, 55 lbs down.

I know weight loss feels overwhelming when you have a lot to lose. But I swear, sometimes the smallest, dumbest habits are the ones that actually work.

12jpiil,SuitableWallaby4512,Wegovy,"Hello, I recently decided to get my life in order after too many years of letting it go to sh!t. I was 230 pounds in February of 2020. I suffered a severely broken ankle that required screws and a plate and then the following year in May of 2021 I broke my opposite leg requiring a rod and some screws. I ballooned up to 330 pounds where I have stayed.
I decided several weeks ago to make a change and started working out again. And I have seen positive results. I have lost around 11 pounds already. Now I will get to my question: I was recently prescribed Wegovy and it arrived in the mail this morning. I am super excited but I wanted to know if there is anything I should prepare myself for? Side effects or anything like that? I know what the package says, but I want to hear from people who have actually taken the medication. What are the side effects? How long does it take to work? What happens if I suddenly stop taking it? Etc‚Ä¶
Anyway, I remain extremely dedicated to getting this weight off and am really hoping this gives me that extra edge to do so.

I don‚Äôt want to share personal details here because im paranoid someone I know will find this. I recently gained 30 lbs after I started dating my boyfriend. He eats a lot, so I ate a lot. It slowly crept up on me and before I knew it my doctor told me I was overweight. 
I wasn‚Äôt super overweight, but enough where my insurance approved my wegovy prescription. Im now on .5 mg dose and I love it. Not much bad side effects. It‚Äôs made me eat barely anything now. 
Only problem, is it‚Äôs been almost a month and a half and I‚Äôve only lost 5 lbs. I go to school, and I wanted to lose a bunch of weight before school starts again and have a ‚Äúglow up‚Äù. 
I count calories and eat about 1200-1300 cals a day. I wear a fit bit and try to burn at least 2000 cals a day.

12dmzew,Agreeablemartini,Starting wegovy! Follow along for updates.,"I picked up my first 4 shots (one weekly) of 0.25 mg wegovy today! I‚Äôm going to administer the first one on Monday. I‚Äôm a 29 year old 5‚Äô 5‚Äù woman and my starting weight fluctuates between 240-250lbs. It‚Äôs been really difficult shedding weight so I‚Äôm trying this now in hopes for a little extra push in addition to working out three times a week with a relatively healthy diet which I‚Äôve been doing for a few years. 
I‚Äôll update as I can!
Here is the [wegovy website](https://www.wegovy.com/about-wegovy/why-wegovy.html) if you want more official info. 

Mon April 10 
9:00AM- I just did my first shot and it was easy breezy! Directions are super straight forward and the pen is easy to use. The needle is so tiny I didn‚Äôt even feel it going into my leg. The pen will click when you put it in and then click again about 2 Mississippi second later to say that it‚Äôs done. The needle automatically retracts and you can put the cap back on so the chance of an accidental stick is very low. I will check back later today if I feel any side affects. 
Scale this morning said 241 lbs

Fri April 14
The side effects haven‚Äôt been awful, but I have had a tummy ache all week and have been super tired. Not nauseous the way the side effects say, but more of a bloated burn-y sensation. Lots of burping? I‚Äôve also been super tired, but that may be from another medication since it doesn‚Äôt specifically say tiredness as a side effect. My appetite has been significantly reduced but I can‚Äôt tell if that‚Äôs a good thing or not because it‚Äôs been difficult to eat much of anything and may also account for the tiredness. Scale this morning was 233 lbs.

Monday April 17 - just did the second dose this morning. Definitely easier the second time around! The nausea eased up over the week, but I‚Äôm nervous it will start over again today. We shall see. Scale says 241 lbs this morning.

Saturday April 22 - the nausea that I was feeling most of last week was MUCH less this week. I did experience some heart racing after drinking a cup of coffee a couple days ago, but it difficult to say if that‚Äôs because of the wegovy or a recently increased dose of vyvanse. Scale this morning was 237 lbs.

Thursday April 27 - unsure if it‚Äôs wegovy related, but I have had horrible diarrhea this week. Very bad Monday and last night/today. It does say that it is a side effect so I thought it would be best to document it. This is after taking the 3rd shot of the month. Scale today is 237.

Thursday May 18 - i still get random bouts of diarrhea here and there and it kinda sucks. I also noticed a lot of burping lately and saw that it was a side effect of Wegovy. Appetite is very low‚Äî almost too low. There is zero snacking between meals and most meals I can only get half way through. Might be a good sign, but my energy is super low. Scale is still at 233‚Äì wish I was seeing a little more movement after a month and a half. I‚Äôm still on the same first dose for some reason. Maybe I‚Äôll see more when I move to the next dose.",1,6,2023-04-06T20:31:51,WeightLossAdvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/12dmzew/starting_wegovy_follow_along_for_updates/,0.57,True,/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/12dmzew/starting_wegovy_follow_along_for_updates/

qanxvt,timmyrae,Wegovy - First Week,"I just began taking Wegovy last week and thought others might find my experience interesting/helpful.  

(By the way, this is my first post on Reddit...I joined just to hear about other people's Wegovy experiences and thought I would add mine too in case it's helpful.  Sorry this post is a bit long winded.)

A few statistics--I am a 40 year old cis-male, I currently weight 378 pounds and I am 6'0"".  In addition, I think it is important to know that I am an attorney at a large firm and the pressure and anxiety is, at times, nearly overwhelming, particularly during the last 9 months.  During that time I gained close to 80 pounds from binge eating.  I rarely snack between meals or after dinner, but I will eat extremely large portions and will often order meals for 2 and eat both in one sitting.  I have not cooked a meal at home since February 2021 and clearly do not order the healthiest of delivery options.

I met with an endocrinologist in NYCto discuss weight management/loss options.  If anyone in the NYC area is looking for a clinic like this, I would recommend this highly.  Happy to share more info.

After discussing my eating habits, lifestyle, motivations, etc., we discussed medication options.  Essentially there were 3 choices I was given--one typically given to treat diabetes (apologies as I do not remember the name), Topomax and Wegovy.  Frankly, I came to the clinic hoping I would be prescribed Wegovy, but did not ask before the doctor provided these options as I wanted to hear what she recommended without my influence.

As others have noted, getting the beginning level dose of Wegovy can be difficult.  Both because many pharmacies are unable to keep it in stock due to lagging production unable to keep pace with the extreme demand and because many insurance providers are not (yet) covering the $1300 drug.  Unfortunately, my insurance denied coverage.  The manufacturer has a coupon for $200 off, but even with that the first month cost around $1100.  I am lucky to be able to afford this for a few more months, but it may be a complete non-starter for many people.

I used Alto to deliver the medication and it came in a box with ice packs to keep it cool.  You store the box in the refrigerator until ready to use.  I was nervous about the injection itself, but my concern was misplaced.  It was extremely easy and needle is never visible and is extremely small--I truly barely felt it.  I chose to inject on a fatty part of my stomach.  You push the pin in until you hear a click and then you watch a yellow bar that moves down a clear window on the side of the pin.  As it injects the drug you will hear another click.  You do not remove the pin until the yellow bar reaches (almost) the bottom of the window and quits moving.  I watched a video on YouTube that was posted by the manufacturer too, which is helpful, and they advised to count slowly to 10 before from the first click removing.  Obviously, please read the directions that come with the drugs as I am definitely leaving out some details!

I have not yet experienced any negative side effects, but the doctor told me to plan on small portions to avoid nausea these first few days after which your lack of appetite should help you avoid the big portions altogether.  I have not had much of an appetite today, but candidly I am wondering if this is psychosomatic as I am not sure it could work that quickly.  Perhaps I am wrong!  Regardless, whether it's my mind playing tricks on me or the drug, I'll take it.  I had yogurt both for breakfast and for lunch and fish with vegetables for dinner (trust me, the fish wasn't that healthy, but I was able to stop at only a half portion).

I know that diet and exercise will always be a key part of any effective and lasting weight loss.  I have lost over 100 pounds twice before but have been unable to keep it off.  I am very hopeful that this will be an aid in acheiving lasting health.

My plan is to provide updates once a month as I start on the next dosage and if anything interesting/concerning/exciting happens in the meantime, I'll post that too.  Hope others find this helpful.

(Just want to make it extra clear that I am not a doctor, nor do I have any medical expertise whatsoever!  I really wanted to get an idea of the experiance others have had before starting and I did find a few.  Happy to answer questions about my experience--apologies in advance if it takes a bit for me to respond.)",11,4,2021-10-18T20:06:38,WeightLossAdvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/qanxvt/wegovy_first_week/,0.88,True,/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/qanxvt/wegovy_first_week/

I have a personal trainer who has me working out twice a week (strict work schedule) and wants me eating 2,500-3,000 calories a day and 300 grams of protein a day. I've been struggling to hit those goals because 3,000 calories is a lot of food and I don't have a lot of money (excuses, excuses I know).

I hoped I was at least doing good, but I weighed myself today and I'm at 370lbs...
I'm terrified I'm never going to get this weight off without surgery which I could never afford. I'm trying to improve my diet but I average around 1,500-2,000 calories a day, and not nearly enough protein. Any advice would be appreciated, I'm still learning

1gr5st5,chubbybuddyfat,"Actually sick of it. Under 1000 calories per day, taking prescribed aide, training twice a day, not losing weight ","Here's a fun one. I know it's not sustainable long term, but I wanted to kick-start 20kg off then taper to something more sustainable. Completely over it though. I wouldn't mind if I was losing weight, but literally nothing has come off in 4 weeks. 


Preamble: I used to be extremely fit and healthy. Competed at top levels of sport well into my late 20s and worked in physically demanding fields. Injury hit, got lazy, then fell into deep depression and put on a lot of weight. 
Hit peak 3 months ago of 132kg at 170cm. Am now mid 30s.


Got my head right, got back into a style of training like I was used to and enjoy. Went to doctor as well and was prescribed Wegovy. 8 weeks in now. This is where it gets frustrating. 


First month on 0.25mg Wegovy, and have been religiously training twice a day 5 days/week and once a day the other 2 days. Mixture of 1 hour steady state cardio and another hour of heavy weights for the afternoon session, 1 hour of cardio in the morning. In the first 3 weeks I lost 8kgs. Got to 125kg. Have now been stuck at 125kg for 5 weeks. Have not lost any weight at all in the last 5 weeks.


The last 4 weeks I have been on 1mg Wegovy. 0.5mg was skipped at doctor recommendation, so went from 0.25mg to 1.0mg. Gives me some stomach problems for the first day after injection but fine otherwise. 


The kicker to all this, I've been on 1000 calories or less a day. I have a single meal of 800 calories or less in the evening after my second training session, and 1 tub of yoghurt @ 150 calories. That's it. I fast all day, train fasted, the works. Everything is measured to the gram. Chicken breast, some veggies, some rice. Every fucking day. When I say under 1000 calories per day, I mean it. There is no deviation from this. I supplement my training sessions with a multivitamin. I drink nothing but water. I don't drink alcohol. Don't smoke. No drugs. 


I don't know why I've typed this all out, except to say fuck this. My base metabolic rate should be around 3000 calories per day to maintain my weight. I'm eating less than 1000, training every single fucking day, and for what? The last 5 weeks and not a single kilo lost. Waste of fucking time. Sorry for the rant. This is fucked. I know it's a long road, but to not lose anything in 5 weeks is just bullshit. The math doesn't math.

1ewuawe,I_Mean_Not_Really,I've been plateaued for literally years and I want to give up,"I am truly at a loss on what to do now. 

I'm 37, 5'5 tall, and right at 200 lb. So I'm not as big as you probably think I am, I'm just straight up dad bod. But nothing I've done over years and years has gotten rid of this. 

I'm not going to go through the whole history, but I only eat once a day, and sometimes that's just apples, water, string cheese sometimes and some protein powder. And that's usually not until the afternoon. So lots of intermittent fasting.

I work out two to three times a week, I take supplements like l-carnitine, acetyl l-carnitine, omega-3 fatty acids and berberine.

I also have hyperthyroidism. And I've been taking levothyroxine for, probably 15 years if not more. 

This is a routine I've had for years, and I just maintain it best. 

There was a time when I was at the gym almost every single day, working out for up to 2 hours, taking creatine, doing muscle building exercises, doing plenty of cardio. And 6 months of that, I only lost 10 lb. That was maybe 3 years ago.

I'm seriously considering adding something like Wegovy. I am completely fed up.

What's something I can do to avoid that? Is there something I'm missing?

UPDATE: 

A bunch of people have asked so here is my very very typical calorie intake on any given day.

6 apples
16 oz of a fruit and veggie protein shake 
6 individual packets of string cheese 
About 10 cups of water 

So about 1000 calories 

That's almost every day. That is very very typical for me. And this is all in the afternoon. I typically don't eat breakfast or dinner.

This is a routine I've had for years.

And I'm at the gym a couple hours a week.",13,55,2024-08-20T18:01:29,WeightLossAdvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/1ewuawe/ive_been_plateaued_for_literally_years_and_i_want/,0.66,True,/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/1ewuawe/ive_been_plateaued_for_literally_years_and_i_want/

I work a fairly active job. I work at a grocery store so in my everyday i typically walk 5000 steps on a slow day, 7000-10000 steps on a regular day or even 15000+ on a holiday. 

Im not that good of a cook and have mostly ate shit garbage food for the past few years which caused me to gain the 85 lbs since high school. My morbid obesity has taken such a big toll on my mental health, self esteem, and lately my quality of life (very tired, knee pain, hip pain, back pain). I also have high blood pressure, am pre diabetic, and PCOS due to insulin resistance.

I've struggled a lot with my weight but I've recently been having moderate success losing around 35lbs in the last year through diet and Wegovy. I want to start building more muscle but I have a lot of trouble exercising. I don't mind physical activities like going for walks or outdoor sports like kayaking, but when I think of doing things specifically in the mindset of ""exercise"" I lose all motivation. I've had bad experiences in the past with exercising where I felt like I was putting myself through a ton of pain and stress without seeing results that justified the effort. The exercise never got easier, I didn't feel better emotionally or physically, and I had so much constant pain while exercising that it eventually drove me to stop all together. I know lactic acid builds up in muscles as you move and that the pain is actually signs that the muscles are getting stronger, but I can't help but feel like all of the pain is punishment for letting my body wind up the way it currently is and I can't deal with that mental image.

I'm 22 years old, I'm 6'4 and 130kg and I have tried and tried to lose weight ever since I moved to college in 2020 at 98kg but it never sticks for longer than 4 months, l'd lose say 35-45lbs in that time then just stop completely and gain it all back.

Normally due to life events eg. Christmas rolls around and I lose momentum and give up...
I'm now at a stage of my life where l've been out of college for a year and been fully self employed as a photographer in the music industry. Spending a lot of time on the road I find it impossible to stay active and eat well so that's another event where if things are going well I self sabotage and just have to start over.
My question basically is how on earth do you balance life, and keep going with fitness and healthy eating. I know exactly what I need to do but as soon as one of my pillars (nutrition, exercise, sleep) fall away then so do all of the others.

Any advice for me you beautiful people? My dad's getting my remarried just before Christmas and I'd love to be in the best shape I can be by then so any advice would be greatly appreciated!

1hcr0bd,ojfincho,"I‚Äôve (31f) have gained weight after trauma, and need advice to turn my life around ","Hi everyone!

Growing up, I was the ‚Äúchubby kid.‚Äù It was just who I was for most of my childhood. When I got to college, I managed to lose weight, and while I wasn‚Äôt skinny, I was what people might call ‚Äúthick.‚Äù Then grad school happened, and everything changed.

I became anorexic‚Äîalmost accidentally. My schedule was so packed that I‚Äôd forget to eat, and over the course of a year, I lost 90 pounds. Once I noticed how rapidly the weight was coming off, it became intentional. During that time, I also developed bulimia in my quest to stay thin. My relationship with food and my body became complicated, but eventually, the anorexia and bulimia stopped. By my mid-twenties, I had found a balance. I was eating healthy, working out regularly, and finally felt strong and confident.

But now, at 31, things are different. Two years ago, I experienced something that completely shifted my life. I was sexually assaulted, and I turned to food for comfort. The weight started piling on almost immediately, and I was determined to stop it. My ex and I began doing 30-minute workouts together, and I managed to lose 10-15 pounds. But when our relationship ended, so did the workouts. I lost the accountability and motivation to keep going, and the weight came back.

On top of that, my PCOS kicked into high gear, causing rapid weight gain. I was also in a toxic living situation with an alcoholic and abusive father. During that time, I barely left my room and used food as my escape. Thankfully, I‚Äôve since moved out of that environment and am now back in a city surrounded by friends who support me.

One of my closest friends is getting married in August, and she also wants to lose weight before the big day. We‚Äôve been talking about starting to work out together, which I‚Äôm hoping will help me stay consistent.

A few months ago, my doctor prescribed Wegovy, and for the first time in a while, I felt like I was getting back on track. But then I lost my job and had to stop the medication, and since September, I‚Äôve regained about 14 pounds. My health is at risk, and I miss the confidence I once had. I‚Äôm tired of how society treats me based on my weight, and I don‚Äôt know where to start.

I‚Äôm trying to return to old habits that worked‚Äîlike cooking every meal instead of eating out. I‚Äôve even started using HelloFresh again. This week, I‚Äôve lost two pounds just from eating better. But I have a long road ahead. I need to lose 113 pounds to get back to the weight where I felt strong, healthy, and confident.

Here‚Äôs the thing: I hate working out. But when my ex and I used to do those short 30-minute workouts, I could lose weight quickly. I know I can do it because I‚Äôve done it before. I just need guidance on how to start‚Äîespecially since it‚Äôs been so long since I‚Äôve lost weight naturally.

I‚Äôd also love tips and tricks on healthy snacking and weight loss in general. I tend to struggle with cravings and portion control, so any advice to keep things manageable would be amazing. Are there any snacks or simple meal prep ideas that work well for people trying to lose weight?

I‚Äôd also love advice on how to stick to a healthy routine and incorporate workouts I won‚Äôt dread. Are there classes or types of exercise that can help me tone while I lose weight? I have some disposable income, so I‚Äôm open to hiring a personal trainer or trying something new.

I just want my health, confidence, and old life back. If anyone has advice or suggestions, I‚Äôd truly appreciate it.

1hphmk4,TheRealDragon775,Where to even start?,"
Hey there,
Just stumbled across this subreddit doomscrolling at 1am. Currently wanted to get started on my weight loss journey with my gf and I have no clue where to start. 

I am 23M, 6‚Äô1, ~300 lbs, and she is 20F, 5‚Äô8 ~200 lbs. We‚Äôve both always been a bit on the chubbier side all our lives. There was a time in my life roughly 7 ish years ago when I cut gluten and dairy out of my diet completely due to gastrointestinal issues, and immediately the pounds flew off. I got down to a point where I don‚Äôt even recognize myself in pictures anymore compared to my current self. As time progressed, this weight slowly pilled back on and on, to where we are now. 

When my girlfriend and I had first met, she was a bit lighter, she was in a state physically where she was happy with her body and how she looked. She loved to dress in different outfits, take pictures of herself, etc. During the first half of our relationship (approx. 4 months or so), she was vaping frequently, and I believe it acted as an artificial appetite suppressant, as she hardly ate anything all day, just drinking tons of water and light snacking here and there. After she decided to quit vaping, I believe is when the weight gain started. Progressively after that point in time, she began to mention more and more about noticing herself gaining weight in areas (i.e less defined jawline, wider waist, more tummy, etc). 

It is currently at a point where she is disgusted with how she looks and feels absolutely grossed out in her own skin. She now hates going out as much, says that none of her clothes fit her anymore, doesn‚Äôt take pictures of herself anymore, and sometimes gets emotional when thinking about it. As described, it‚Äôs making changes to her lifestyle, enjoyment she gets out of things, sex drive, general mood, etc. and it breaks my heart. 

I am not in a similar state as her where I hate how I look so deeply. Sure, I am unhappy with my body, but not to the degree she is unhappy with hers. To clarify, I have no issues with my girlfriend or her weight or how she looks, I love every single bit of her and I wouldn‚Äôt change a thing. However, I see how she feels about herself and I want to help her feel comfortable with herself again, and I want to do it along with her, together. 

Currently, she tries to watch what she eats, but will occasionally binge eat or eat too much, and then sometimes purge as a result. Her water intake is still good, I just want to find something for us to do that sticks and we can stay consistent with. 

I have taken a couple first steps myself by seeing a weight loss specialist (after several months of waiting due to appointment availability) for an initial evaluation and questions. We discussed the possibility of medication, and gave me information to go to with insurance. Insurance doesn‚Äôt cover it in a way that makes it affordable (roughly $500/month for Zepbound or Wegovy). I have an appointment with a dietician in a couple of days, and I have a couple days of calorie counting to show as my ‚Äúhomework‚Äù. I also was advised to get A1C Blood Testing done for further insurance coverage. Depending on how that all goes, I may have some more options for myself. 

As for her, her insurance doesn‚Äôt cover medication at all, and she currently doesn‚Äôt have a primary practitioner, only a doctor she sees when needed through family Union benefits. I want to try and find her a weight loss specialist or dietician in her network, but even with my insurance, it was funky finding coverage for the dietician appointments. 

What initial steps/advice does anyone have to get started or changes to make off the bat? Any and all advice is appreciated!

1ei34na,taffysamg,I feel like I‚Äôm doing everything right and it‚Äôs not working. Any advice? ,"I used to lose/gain weight incredibly quickly when I was young, but then suddenly once I hit college I just started gaining with no losing. I don‚Äôt want this to be super long so I‚Äôll just summarize- 

I was dieting and exercising with no success, so once I hit 250lbs I decided to try rolling 72hr fasts. Basically didn‚Äôt eat aside from one meal every 72hours, water only. This was finally working, and I was losing 5-10lbs a week. I felt as though I‚Äôd figured out the solution- college classes had me more sedentary, so I needed to eat less to make up for it. 

Just this week I took a vacation to London. I was walking approximately 20k steps a day and sweating in the sun, and it just wasn‚Äôt possible without food, so I ate 1-2 meals a day. All rounded and healthy, good protein, veg, carb, and I always stopped when I felt satisfied, not full. Even the desserts I occasionally had were low-sugar and fairly small. I got home today, expecting to see a sustained weight or even a little loss (from the extra activity). I gained nearlyv20 pounds. In a week. I didn‚Äôt even know that was possible.

I don‚Äôt know what to do. My doctor offered me Wegovy/Ozempic, but my problem isn‚Äôt eating. I feel like my body has some sort of underlying problem where everything I eat just instantly becomes fat. I don‚Äôt know what to do. Has anyone faced this and/or knows what could be going on?

1gbkl75,LocozillaYT,My weight-loss journey & some questions. Help definitely welcome.,"Hello Everyone,

I'm new to this sub-reddit. Quick rundown on myself. I was involved in a high speed motorcycle accident years ago, I was the dumb ass that thought ""I'm only going to lunch, this isn't a long ride"" with it being the end of July and over 100¬∞ F at the time, I was also the dumb ass that was on a sport bike wearing only a t-shirt, shorts and some airforce ones thinking nothing is going to happen on a 20 minute ride.

Long story short I was cut off on the expressway going 80MPH and when i slammed on my brakes I went over the windshield at 80MPH and well after tumbling, rolling, sliding and tossed around I ended up in the hospital with 60% of my skin gone, and permanent back, hip & knee injuries (I also have permanent nerve damage in both feet, both legs and parts of my back). Before my accident I was 6'2"" @ 205lbs and in the gym 4 days a week. After my accident though I was in the hospital for nearly a month and bed bound and home cared for about 5 months. After my open wounds healed though I still obviously dealt with my back, hip & knee injuries (the nerve damage also causes a good amount of pain on days as well). The injuries caused me so much pain that I wasn't able to be in the gym and frankly hard to move at all.

After that accident I spiraled into horrible depression and ended up gaining wayyyyy to much weight over the years. I have been working on myself mentally over the years to deal with the depression but now I am 6'2"" and 400lbs , so now that I am good with myself mentally it is long over due to work on myself physically! So I wanted to come to this sub-reddit and get any helpful hints or tips to do just that!

About 4.5-5 months ago I was 450lbs, starting June (2024) I started a much needed diet where I cut out all sugar drinks and cut out most sweets and my diet is now something I am mindful about everyday. I try to stick with grilled chicken or tuna & usually a salad with light low fat dressings. I feel like my diet is something I have a decent hold on, and since June (2024) I have lost 50lbs‚Äã in that 4.5-5 months time but now I need to get the exercise part of my life under control now! My only problem is that I still deal with the back, hip and knee pain (my left knee actually needs a total knee replacement but my doctor wants me to lose the weight first). So I need to find the best exercises that I can do with low impact, right now all I have is the resistance bands. I want to put together a exercise plan that will be best for me and figured I would reach out to this sub-reddit to get any hints and tips on what else I should do as well. I want to starting going on longer and longer walks everyday as well. Also side note, I even tried to get prescribed WeGovy (which is a Ozempic like medication) because I really need to ditch this weight as fast as possible so I can get the much needed Total Knee Replacement surgery asap. Unfortunately my insurance rejected the medication, so all the weight-loss so far is natural without medication but to be honest my doctor is still trying to get my insurance to approve that medication and if they actually approve it I will take it, so just wanted to be honest with ya'll. I just want to lose what I can as fast as I can for the surgery I need, after the surgery though I am not sure if I'll stick with the medication or not I guess it all comes down to how well it works and how it makes me feel.

One other thing I would like some input on is which fitness tracker would be best for me as well, because I want to do more & more with my walks,(with my fucked up left knee the walks are rough but I get as far as I can with my cane) one important thing is I want a fitness tracker with GPS so I can track my progression. I am however on a budget, I run my own business but because of the pain lately my business has been hurting just as much as my back, hip & knees lol (its just been rough getting through the work day with the pain), so I would like to keep the fitness tracker under $90 if possible. I think I have it down to 5 to pick from (the FitBit Charge 6 is $140 or so on Amazon but I found a few on ebay for under $90-$100). If you folks would like to take a look at the 5 options and let me know which is best that would help me out as well or maybe I missed a better option under $90. I know there are SOOO many different options when it comes to fitness trackers and a lot of the better ones are over $150, so I know these aren't ""top of the line"" options, but it's what I have to work within my under $90 budget, so if there is something I missed please let me know.

‚óè Fitbit Charge 6

‚óè Amazfit GTR 3

‚óèAmazfit GTR Mini

‚óèAmazfit Bip 5

‚óè Fitbit Inspire 3 (this one I will probably pass on because I don't believe it has a GPS but i've heard good things about it so was wondering what everyone else thought compared to the others)

Thanks in advance for any help you guys give. I wish I never got to this point, but now that I have, it is now time to turn that around! So any tips you folks can give to me for low impact exercises or other tips I should know, everything would be helpful. If there is anything I missed or should have mentioned please let me know that as well. After losing 60% of my skin I do have a lot of scars and thin skin but I don't think any of that should affect my exercising, the thing hardest for me right now is my left knee, because that knee is basically bone on bone until my surgery I will just need to push through that pain to loss the weight so I am able to get the Total Knee Replacement surgery that is needed to fix that problem. The back and hip pain though is something I feel like I can push through as long as I don't over do anything.

Thanks again,

xgtpr0,celoplyr,I did it!!! -25% of body weight in about a year.,"So I weighed myself this morning and after 6 weeks of being about 185, im now 181. That‚Äôs 60 pounds down in a year from my 241 (im 5‚Äô2‚Äù 39F). 

Like many chronically overweight people I thought I could never really lose the weight. I went down 40 pounds before COVID, gained it all back by being pretty depressed and now I‚Äôm down lower than I‚Äôve been in a decade. Heck, I‚Äôm even under my drivers license weight ;)

How did I do it? I joined a bariatric clinic. I found a system that I thought would work for me and I said ‚Äúthis is my last resort‚Äù. I didn‚Äôt want to do surgery, because I‚Äôve seen how difficult surgery can be. It was appetite suppressants and meal replacements. I stopped the meds pretty quickly because they made me feel really jittery, but kept the meal replacements. I lost the first 40 pounds in ~6 months. 

After COVID I had tried almost every prescribed drug out there, and wegovy had come out. I also had a lot of other health issues (I‚Äôve lost my gallbladder and my appendix in 2020, yay me!) so insurance covered it. That‚Äôs what I needed to make it ‚Äúeasy‚Äù and I‚Äôve been on it since June of last year, and I started losing weight around this time last year due to titrating up the dose. Sometimes I go back on the meal replacements (although I‚Äôm not as strict as I was). 

The other thing I did that really is important is weight loss therapy. Get the learned behaviors of emotional eating and I‚Äôll always be fat and no one will love me skinny, etc out of my head. 

Cons of this way? It‚Äôs expensive. I have the money to do it, but it‚Äôs ~$300 for meds and doc, $400 for therapy and ~$500 for food a month. (Plus the money for new clothes!! New clothes that become too big quickly!)

Anyways, we all have different journeys. If you‚Äôre struggling, keep at it, try new things and I hope you find the ‚Äúeasy‚Äù way to do it. East is in quotes because it‚Äôs never easy, but hopefully one way clicks for you.",308,13,2022-09-17T23:50:32,WeightLossAdvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/xgtpr0/i_did_it_25_of_body_weight_in_about_a_year/,0.99,True,/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/xgtpr0/i_did_it_25_of_body_weight_in_about_a_year/

I have a baby shower to go to in 2 weeks and I am so scared of what people who have not seen me in 6 years will think.

1c2qx5r,Booseygirl,I don‚Äôt know where to start. ,"33 years old, female, 325lbs or so. Goal weight is 125lbs. 

I was recently diagnosed with PCOS and Endometriosis and will be starting Wegovy once my health benefits kick in at my new job. I work at a desk job so not much movement other than me being alive right now. 

I‚Äôve been cutting out everything and eating portion sizes as close as possible. We cook at home and usually only eat out once a week or so. Desserts I‚Äôve limited to once or twice a week (a single serving size or as close to). Not snacking, and if I do, it‚Äôs usually on fruit. 

We‚Äôve been cooking more healthily at home and I‚Äôm starting to feel much more full after just eating dinner. I did intermittent fasting for a long time and now I don‚Äôt typically get hungry until 11am or 12pm, so I usually eat lunch and dinner. I‚Äôve been drinking water, Coke Zero, or other diet drinks we buy or when I go out. 

I feel like I‚Äôm not seeing any weight loss whatsoever. I signed up for a Y membership but I don‚Äôt know what to do. In school, I was always told that girls do cardio, so that‚Äôs all I can really do. I don‚Äôt know where to start with other routines. My arms and legs are my biggest issue, they‚Äôre the largest parts of me. I‚Äôm smaller in the middle. 

I guess im just looking for advice, work out routines, and just general help for what I can do to start losing weight. I don‚Äôt want to be this way anymore and I‚Äôm so tired of it.

1e6dck2,PrestigiousRemove595,How do I stop binging ,"I‚Äôve been slowly gaining weight over the past 3 years. I went from 160 to 215 lbs as a 5‚Äô6 woman, the most I‚Äôve ever weighed. I weight lift pretty regularly I would say about 3-4 times a week, however I do struggle with maintaining a calorie deficit as I struggle with binge eating - we‚Äôre working on that. I just seem to have a problem controlling my appetite and the food noise and find myself binging on the weekends. 

I recently started lexapro 10mg about 6 months ago and have gained 15 lbs since then. Lexapro has definitely helped with my underlying anxiety but I feel like it has contributed to my increased appetite. 

I‚Äôve started including cardio into my workouts now - anything from 12-3-30 to daily walks. I want to avoid ozempic/wegovy although my pcp does recommend and even prescribed it. Is there any natural appetite suppressant to help calm the food noise/binge eating or just any advice in general

1h42fbh,Past_Court_1344,NEED HELP!!!,"I have a fatal flaw: when I see food I eat it! 
[EDIT: i eat without realizing it]

My hubby used to work 12 hour days (he‚Äôs in healthcare so his job doesn't have to follow regular worker safety standards) so when he was at work, i‚Äôd put away all the food & only have a light lunch after work. That worked really well & I lost 25 lbs. But it never addressed the core problem. 

However, a couple months ago, he got an office job and his office has a space shortage so he has to work from home indefinitely. He‚Äôs also a skinny guy so now that his job isn't as physically or mentally taxing, he‚Äôs trying to bulk. 

As a result, i‚Äôm constantly in the kitchen cooking him meals or bringing him snacks. And as we‚Äôve established, I have no self control so when I see food, I eat it! I‚Äôve almost gained all the weight back - 1.5 years of work undone in 3 months! 

More considerations: 
- calorie counting sends me into a very unhealthy spiral
- I work retail so i‚Äôm constantly on my feet. I view working as steady state cardio because i‚Äôm basically fast walking for my entire shift. I try to workout after work but I usually don't have the energy. 
- lol my insurance won‚Äôt cover ozempic or wegovy unless my weight is literally killing me & at the moment, I don‚Äôt appear to be dying
- yes, I do have untreated adhd. I was diagnosed as a kid by a psychiatrist but my shitty family doctor convinced my parents i‚Äôm fine & big pharma is just trying to push drugs on kids. I‚Äôve since got a better doctor but he needs record of that diagnosis (which I'm struggling to find because it was so long ago) or a new diagnosis ($$$$$)

I was run over by a piece of equipment  (driver on cellphone) and was badly injured. I spent 4 months not being able to move and another 5 in recovery before I could walk unassisted. When I was in the hospital via X Rays they found that my Thyroid was enlarged due to a ""Goiter"". I was given a drug that was supposed to shrink the Goiter and while it did its job it threw my hormones out of whack and it caused me to gain a serious amount of weight in the last year. I was told this would happen and I watched what I ate but beings as how I couldnt move for over 9 months I gained quite a bit of weight. I was already a heavy person before all of this (6'4"" 248lbs) now I am 344lbs. I have since been off that Thyroid Goiter shrink medication and have started going back to work. I have lost 24 pounds in the past 3 months. I however need to work harder to put the weight off faster. I would like to lose at least 100 pounds by March 1st of 2025 as that would be 2 years since my whole life went upside down. I would like to get myself down to around 230 to 235 by then and hopefully go further to about 200lbs. I got a gym membership and I am going to start doing a Calorie Defecit Diet of 800 to 1200 calories a day. I work a physically intensive manual labor job working on large trucks and equipment and I will incorporate weight lifting and cardio into my gym routine. What is a good work out starting point. My doc says to take it easy as my right knee still isnt 100% neither is my left foot. I was told by a fella at the gym that 500 steps on the step machine, 5 min sprints on the treadmill and some time on the eliptical are a good start. I used to bench 225 quite regularly but I will start back at 180 and work my way back up until I know I am 100% healed same with the squat rack i used to easily squat 425lbs but the other day I could barely do 245lbs. Getting run over isnt good for your health lol. Anyway is this a good start to meet my goal in March 2025 ? Just trying to lose about 100~110lbs to start. If anyone has some tips lay em down. So far my physician wants to go with Ozempic or Wegovy and I dont trust medications not after what I went through with that Thyroid medication.

He recommended Contrave but after reading through long list of side effects, I am kinda paranoid. Other medications in market are Wegovy/Ozempic and Oristat. Has anybody taken these meds and can share their experience? How soon do you see results?

1gd2jfk,JennyJ0522,Medications for Weight Loss?,"My husband was already overweight, but after marrying me, he gained even more weight and now has a BMI over 32, putting him in the obese range. The only exercise he does is walking our dog for about an hour a day, and he absolutely loves eating, especially fried foods and desserts like ice cream and cake. Sometimes, it feels like he genuinely can‚Äôt control his appetite.

My concern has shifted from just his appearance to his health. His sleep apnea has worsened to the point that he‚Äôs recently started using a CPAP machine, and while he doesn‚Äôt have high blood pressure yet, it‚Äôs a bit above normal. His doctor has recommended he lose some weight, but he doesn‚Äôt seem to be making any effort to do so. It‚Äôs like he has no motivation at all. Right now, he doesn‚Äôt appear to have any serious health issues because he‚Äôs still relatively young, but I worry that in a few years, he‚Äôll inevitably develop hypertension and diabetes.

I‚Äôm wondering how I could help him find motivation to lose weight, and I thought about the possibility of using medication like Wegovy initially, to help kickstart his weight loss journey. The idea would be to combine it with a balanced diet and exercise with me. However, I‚Äôm a bit concerned because no one around me, including myself, has any experience with using medication for weight loss.

I am also on Wegovy for PCOS and pre-diabetes. I lost about 12 pounds on my own the first month. Then joined a gym and got a coach/trainer to help me build muscle while losing weight. My weight loss slowed after the first month/joining the gym. I met with my coach today and we noticed that a lot of my measurements/bf% have actually gone up in the last month, so we did a deeper diver into my nutrition. I am usually eating about 1500-1600 calories and \~100-120g of protein per day. My coach seems to think this is not enough food to fuel my weight loss, especially with the recent increase in activity. He suggested that I should be eating closer to 2500-2700 per day with more than 200g of protein. This honestly doesn't really feel achievable for me though. Especially with the Wegovy in the mix, which suppresses my appetite a lot. It also makes me REALLY NERVOUS because the idea of increasing my calories by like 1000 per day seems super counterintuitive to everything I know about weight loss.

Hello all. I am a 6'2 male that currently weighs 260lbs. Trying to figure out how much I should be eating.

I was 330ish lbs at the time and have lost about 70lbs since. Looking to be around 240 come Thanksgiving and maybe get down to 200ish sometime later and then maintain.

I usually eat 3 maybe 4 times a day. For breakfast I have a protein shake and 2 large coffee with french vanilla creamer, dinners vary but I usually consume 400-600ish calories. Lunch is kinda what I'm trying to figure out. I was eating about 300ish worth of calories but wondering if I should try and eat more (maybe 500-600)?

1cao06a,hom84164-cdfaq,How do I help my mother lose weight?,"Hi folks, I‚Äôm here about my mother.
(I‚Äôd like to clarify she‚Äôs asked for my help and advice on this since she can‚Äôt find anything herself online, and her doctors have all told her ‚Äústarve or suffer‚Äù with this.)

My mother is around 45, and has both PCOS and Thyroid issues. She‚Äôs on a few different mood stabilisers and she‚Äôs on birth control. Within the past 10 years, she‚Äôs slowly and surely gained weight no matter what she does. 

She‚Äôs tried keto, borderline starved herself with that, and gained weight. She‚Äôs tried calorie counting, high protein, vegetarian, everything we could find, and she‚Äôs either gained weight at a slightly slower rate, been unaffected, or gained weight.

Recently, she was taken off a medicine that extrapolated that (and is slowly weening off of it, as it‚Äôs a mood stabiliser) and was advised to visit an endo to see about weight loss. He told her she should never eat carbs if she wants to lose weight, needs 70g of protein a day, and needs to run at least an hour a day. He also said that if that doesn‚Äôt work, she can forget it. This is what pushed her to ask me if I‚Äôve seen anything online, and to post here.

My mother‚Äôs time is incredibly limited, as her days usually consist of Wake up>Work>Go home at dinner>have an hour to herself (that she‚Äôs always exhausted during)>sleep. Weekends aren‚Äôt much better, as Sat she visits my dad/does chores (which I help with, but I can‚Äôt do everything), and Sunday she goes to church and rests. We‚Äôve gotten an indoor walking pad, but it‚Äôs not the best as we got it secondhand, and barely goes above a stroll. 

Is there anything I can advise her to do? I‚Äôve already recommended she get a new Endo, but the area I live in isn‚Äôt known for having the best doctors. Any tips would be appreciated!",7,9,2024-04-23T03:52:59,WeightLossAdvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/1cao06a/how_do_i_help_my_mother_lose_weight/,0.82,True,/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/1cao06a/how_do_i_help_my_mother_lose_weight/
1ewcp3n,Calm_Bullfrog5363,Thinking about weight loss medication (seeking support),"Hi All! It‚Äôs funny, I saw I posted a question around one year ago about seeking support. I started in July of 2022 at 430 pounds. Last year, I was 367 pounds. This year at this time, I‚Äôm at 326 pounds. It‚Äôs been consistent throughout the last two years. A lot of balancing intuitive eating, journaling, increasing activity, and trauma work surrounding emotional eating. It‚Äôs great progress! 

My weight loss doctor shared how I should celebrate my achievements. I was thinking about it. Over the last two years, its been constant pros and cons about food, journaling (difficult balancing obsessive and avoidant), checking in with my body on what it needs, meeting those needs, and learning about me. Most of that being what will need to continue, I mainly am tired of the mental energy required for meeting nutrient requirements and pros and cons. My bloodwork looks the best it ever has. I‚Äôm tired. Not all the time. But today, I am tired. 

Taking medicine is not weak. Taking medicine doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm giving up. Part of me wants to celebrate by asking for a prescription for medicine like wegovy or ozempic (I know my doctor can refuse or ask questions to verify if it will be the right choice for me). The goal would be to push me to my final goal of weight loss for this time in my life; pushing me from around 1 pound a week to 2 pounds a week of weight loss. Im 6‚Äô5‚Äù. My goal being 225 and around 18% fat on my body. Right now, my scale says 39% (it started at 48% body fat). 

When I‚Äôm seeking support: I mainly am asking does this make sense? I‚Äôm open to people challenging it because there are so many factors to consider. 

Also, it‚Äôs not about aesthetics entirely. I want to look good. I also want to ride roller coasters and not worry about if I can fit. I want to fit comfortably in a plane seat (as much as possible). I want to not have to go to special stores for clothing. I want to be able to run efficiently without worrying about joint damage.

1g9icfs,beansproutandbug,Been stuck for months,"I've been stuck at the same weight (230 lbs) since March. Last year around this time I decided to really make a change. I took two weeks to really track what I ate without adjusting at all. I ate an average 2300 calories with a high of 3600 and a low of 1600. Without any guidance I restricted to a range of 1700-1800. I dropped weight pretty fast and pretty easily. Losing 1-2 pounds a week until March where it plateaued. 

I started PT for my knee in May. I fell off the tracking wagon in June/July, but didn't gain much. In August I hopped back on tracking, finally met with a weight loss physician. Got a DEXA and RMR scan to see how much fat I have, where it is and how many calories I burn resting. It was 1600 calories. So my weight specialist guided me to go down to 1500, on days I exercise more 1600 and when I couch potato 1400. 


I'm still in PT and have started seeing massive improvements. The exercise made me feel better. My partner's mom was getting rid of her excercise bike so I got it and being able to just walk to another room in my PJs instead of getting up and ready and going somewhere else made it so much easier to be motivated to exercise so I started working out every day, with active rest days to give my body a break. In September, I started Wegovy. Not cause I don't believe its possible to lose the weight without, but because I'm on a time crunch. I need to lose 40 more pounds to get a breast reduction, and have a year and half before I lose health insurance. I need 6 months for the surgery and recovery time. So i need to lose 40 lbs in the next year. 

I feel much better. I feel more stronger and more energetic. Even little things like actually squatting down for things instead of sitting or bending. My Physical Therapist has looked over my exercise, my doctor has looked over my food tracking. She said the Wegovy just takes time, but even without that I should be losing weight. I'm eating usually 1500-1600 calories and working out when a year ago I was at 2300 calories and not working out at all. I love that I FEEL so much better, but insurance doesn't care about that. They want to see me drop pounds.

1e7k51x,Various_Committee478,Eating too much or nothing at all,"I've been trying to lose weight with diet/exercise and have been trying to incorporate generally healthier living into my daily life. 

My biggest issue, though, is with eating. I don't *enjoy* food. The way it's made is gross, the ingredients are gross, what happens to it once we ingest it is gross, it feels gross to digest.....and don't even get me started on animal products. I just don't like food outside of a couple occasional things. Then I'll start to get a headache, not feel well, come full-circle, and overeat ""just because"". 

I'm struggling to find a middle ground between not having to eat much and still getting some nutrition. I'll usually consume 400-500 calories for a few days before going back to a day of overeating.

What I'm really wanting is a form of balanced, spread-out nutrition that keeps the sickness/headache away while still not requiring me to eat a whole meal. I recently started on Wegovy and I've been reading about their whole recommended diet. For someone who's too picky to do that, I'd really like to find some sort of meal replacement or other way of ""eating"" without actually eating.

I lost about 15lbs very quickly probably because that was the highest weight I‚Äôd ever been in my life and I‚Äôd had an injury that forced me to be even more sedentary than usual.

Now I‚Äôve plateaued at 236 for several weeks. My clothing had started to feel looser, especially around my waist but now my stomach feels puffy again.

The advice I‚Äôm getting for my diet is more protein, less fat. I‚Äôm tracking  using LoseIt and doing a little intermittent fasting. Also started Rybelsus. My macros are 41% fat 28 carbs 30 protein. I‚Äôm thrilled about it because I could eat 100% carbs and not notice. 

They want me to do 30/30/40. Add more shakes, more bars, more powders. To me all of that sounds horrible, all that processed chemical stuff. So I can tolerate them,  I‚Äôm trying to buy the ones that are healthier, plant based, low allergen. This one brand of bars they recommended has 14g protein, but it also has 13g fat - how is this lowering my fat intake? They also tell me to eat cheese if hungry. Another piece of advice was, food should give you joy. Oh okay so a manufactured brick of protein bar or some protein powder is joyful?

A typical breakfast is 2 hard boiled eggs, berries with plain Greek yogurt. Lunch and dinner are mixed salad greens, a protein (salmon, skinless roasted chicken, other prepared meats from Whole Foods), sometimes a sprinkle of feta or goat cheese, I spray on olive oil, and plain balsamic vinegar. Snack is an OWYN 32g protein shake. Then I started adding in bulletproof collagen powder and Aloha bars this week to get more protein and I feel bloated and blecch.

He started me on rybelsus, then switched me to Mounjaro when I hit a 6 month plateau. The Mounjaro was affecting my antidepressants, and every week, I would have a really bad day of depression, so I stopped taking it. By that point I had lost 87 lb. 

I switched back to the Rybelsus (I had an extra box somehow) and stopped seeing the doctor when he told me to ‚Äútake a break and come back when you‚Äôre serious about losing weight.‚Äù I‚Äôm not going back to him anymore after that comment, because I am serious about it, I‚Äôm just struggling. 

Since I stopped seeing him, I‚Äôve been trying my hardest to stick to 1500 calories a day, 100 oz of water, yet my weight has gone up almost 10 lb. I don‚Äôt always stick to 1500 cal, but I‚Äôm tracking in MyFitnessPal and for the most part, I hover between 1500 and 2000 cal/day.  It seems every day the scale is up a little more. 

What do I do? I‚Äôm fairly active, though I don‚Äôt go to the gym like I should. I move around at work a lot, and I‚Äôve been reorganizing my home since my divorce over a year ago, so for the most part I‚Äôm moving around at home too. I don‚Äôt keep much junk food in my house, and I don‚Äôt drink sodas. I have a pedal exerciser that I use occasionally, resistance bands, etc.

I have done Ozempic last year for 5 months and could only get to the .5 dose due to brutal night time vomiting. I would literally wake up with vomit in my mouth despite having my last meal at 5pm the night before. It also, after some time on it, stopped taking the food noise away. I am now back to an A1C of 8.3, cholesterol is in higher range as well as Cortisol and now Triglyceride's and Lymphocytes are up.  
I really feel like I'm falling apart. I have a stressful life, I am a single Mom who is the sole caregiver for one of my adult kids who has profound autism. I have to get healthy again with the least amount of side effect in order to be there for him. He is my heart.  
I know my weight is causing these problems because I was fine before the weight gains. I need to lose 50 lbs so I really want to go back on a GLP-1 asap.  
I have a Dr. appointment at a clinic next week ( in BC we are short on Doctors and mine retired so Clinics it is) and I would like to ask him for a better suited GLP-1 as well as a diabetes nutritionist.  
Any thoughts you could pass along to me would be much appreciated.

1mtrn7a,NoAbbreviations8030,HbA1c down from 9.0 to 5.9 in 3 months: what to do from here?,"Hello everyone! First, I want to say thanks to everyone for helping me get here. When I was first diagnosed I was very lost and y‚Äôall gave me the motivation and help I needed to get better. I had my bloodwork done recently at the 3 month mark of my diagnosis, and the HbA1c level came back as 5.9, a huge drop from my initial 9.0!

I tried getting on Metformin initially, but my IBS and already existing GI issues did not want to cooperate, and I had to do this through diet and exercise alone, which brings me to my question: where do I go from here? Do I just keep doing the same thing for the rest of my life?

The reason why I ask is because, although doable, it is VERY difficult. In the past 3 months I essentially had to cut out anything with carbs and that was not easy. So I want to explore different ways I can manage my symptom without having to deprive myself of the things I enjoy for the rest of my life. I‚Äôm not looking for a magical solution that will let me eat a whole pie to myself and wash it down with beer and be fine like before I was diagnosed, but I want to be able to eat an instant noodle maybe once every 1-2 months without knowing the burden that it is literally killing me slowly.

I‚Äôve read a lot of good things about semaglutides so currently trying to see if I can get my hands on Ozempic and try that route, but wondering if there‚Äôs other things y‚Äôall are doing that help you manage your conditions without having to fully give up on things you enjoy.

1fqdk6l,Bigbrowndonuthole,Feel worse on Ozempic than when I was raw dogging my diabetes  ,"Title sums it up and it‚Äôs making me so irritable and stressed, I do not like this. I‚Äôm going to try to be as succinct as possible with my story *big inhale* 

Was teetering pre diabetic for years and then I got fat (honestly I don‚Äôt even know exactly how tbh but that‚Äôs a separate story for a different sub) and then wam bam YOU HAVE DIABETES. That was like oh maybe 2022?? Anyway I wasn‚Äôt able to come to terms with it and honestly my life is so chaotic the diagnosis wasn‚Äôt even a priority bc well, it honestly couldn‚Äôt be. 

For years up until about a month ago, I‚Äôve just been vibing, i.e. not doing jack shit (can we swear on Reddit?) to manage my diabetes. And I‚Äôm still cruising with that method‚Ä¶for now. At least that was what my plan was. I finally am in a place/head space to be responsible or whatever and try to keep this thing tame so my kids don‚Äôt have to lug amputee me around in 25 years. Implementing Ozempic was the first step. I figured once I got that down, I would be encouraged enough to get an even firmer grasp on getting my diabetes in check with some dietary changes or what not. 

I am 5 weeks in on .5, about to take 1mg in the next few days. But mann do I not like me on this. Initially I got the wicked acid reflux and sulfur burps (literally gagging as I type this). Ok, this sucks but shouldn‚Äôt last forever; let‚Äôs keep it going. A little further in humm I‚Äôm starting to not feel hungry at all dang. My beloved McDonald‚Äôs Coke isn‚Äôt even hitting the same‚Ä¶and dare I say, I am craving water ?!? over what I used to refer to as my life juice. Alright then, I guess this is good‚Ä¶ ok nothing in my kitchen even sounds remotely appetizing to me but I am kind of hungry and I haven‚Äôt ate in awhile so I should probably force something down. *continues to stare into fridge and open and close cupboard doors for the next 10 minutes* Welp. Nothing sounds good, so I‚Äôm just going to do something else and maybe my palette will come around‚Ä¶*ends day with only eating a bowl of cereal and my kid‚Äôs leftover meal scraps* Ok I‚Äôm now having to drink water around the clock just to not feel dehydrated. And we don‚Äôt want dehydration for obvious reasons but I‚Äôm pretty much guaranteed to form a migraine, which will then put me down for the remainder of the day. Shit I‚Äôm drinking a lot of water (80 oz at least) this is exhausting‚Ä¶also continue to be very picky with food selection which has never been an issue with me before. 

I kept trying to convince myself this is good, we life this, we are doing the right thing‚Ä¶until I ended up going to the ER for extreme eye pain which at the time I thought to be an adverse reaction of a relatively new med that was prescribed (mental health related) only to be told that everything seems fine other than you‚Äôre just really really dehydrated and the eye pain is probably just a very intense migraine so let‚Äôs hook you up with the good stuff and send you on your way. Wow. For a hot minute there, I felt pretty darn good after receiving IV fluids and whatever else was included in their ‚Äúmigraine cocktail‚Äù. That little pick me up lasted a couple days and now I‚Äôm finding myself back to being chained to my water bottle; even adding electrolytes now and my thirst still cannot be quenched. In fact, I wake up from a short cat nap and my mouth is drier than a mummy‚Äôs membrane if you catch my drift so I better get to chugging. Ugh. NOW, in addition to everything mentioned above, bowel movements are becoming fewer and father inbetween and I‚Äôm noticing I‚Äôm bloated and backed up and even my stretchiest of stretchy pants make my belly uncomfy. I was legitimately panicking earlier today bc I hadn‚Äôt defecated in 3 days aside from some stray pebbles and my insides were clearly stuck in freeze mode. I did what I assume most of have done at least once lol and did some tried and true research on Reddit for a solution. Thanks to whoever recommended supplement Mago7 bc not even an hour after I took the Reddit recommended initial dose (6 capsules), I was riding that gravy train and ooo did it feel so good. 

Which brings me to here. Wondering wth is going on and why would I be experiencing more discomfort, more inconveniences on Ozempic than when I was just living my life with unmanaged diabetes? The ONLY potential positive I‚Äôve experienced would be that I‚Äôm not as fatigued but 1.) that could also be attributed to my new mental health med and 2.) Yes I feel more ‚Äúawake‚Äù but it‚Äôs not a refreshed, let‚Äôs get this bread type of zest. I‚Äôm feeling irritable and ‚Äòoff‚Äô throughout the day bc of this unrelenting thirst and weird dynamic with food and I don‚Äôt like it. Am I nuts or has anyone else had a similar experience? I feel discouraged and I‚Äôm really close to just quitting cold turkey (yes I know that‚Äôs bad and potentially dangerous but old habits die hard) bc I much rather be a tired fat than a miserable skinny fat. Does that make sense? 

I really appreciate you if you made it this far lol. 

***EDIT: Ok I‚Äôm not done reading through and responding to all of your comments and tbh future me might not have the level of willpower and focus I am experiencing now to get through everyone‚Äôs feedback. If that happens, I do apologize but I really do appreciate everyone‚Äôs feedback and sharing their experiences. I follow the Ozempic and Semaglutide subs and folks over there are just orgasmic over this medication lol and I‚Äôm just scratching my head like ??? So reading a lot of what you shared has been grounding and reaffirming - thank you for that. 
Also to clarify I didn‚Äôt feel like shit pre Ozempic me. I mean, not physically speaking. Sure I‚Äôm overweight and get winded easier but I never really  experienced any noticeable, negative effects by just living my life (emphasis on the word NOTICEABLE bc I do realize there‚Äôs a solid chance I‚Äôll be paying the price later down the road). I would label my diet as ‚ÄúStereotypical American‚Äù lol which sounds bad but really it‚Äôs only bc I feed on a lot of convenience foods that aren‚Äôt super nutrient dense. It‚Äôs not that I don‚Äôt enjoy ‚Äòhealthy‚Äô food, it‚Äôs just that often times it requires more energy, time, and labor than I have so I go with whatever is going to be the easiest for me. This is all due to living with severe, chronic mental illness and also I‚Äôm the mother to 2 children, I‚Äôm gonna do whatever makes most sense with our lifestyle. But ok I‚Äôm forgetting what I was initially trying to convey and I‚Äôm falling asleep here so thanks once again and until next time!

I am now back to a BMI of just over 30, so it qualifies me for coverage given my other issues (high bp and high cholesterol). 

I have never taken a glp-1 before, so I‚Äôm a bit nervous. From my understanding, Wegovy is a higher max dose of the same semaglutide in Ozempic. There hasn‚Äôt been much I‚Äôve seen specifically about Wegovy and blood glucose, since it‚Äôs considered a weight loss drug, not a drug approved for diabetes care. However, I have read about possible hypos in Ozempic users. Have you found that to be the case? Do you think the endo could make a case to appeal CGM coverage as a medical necessity if on a drug like Wegovy/Ozempic? 

FYI, she also prescribed a CGM, but it was denied because I don‚Äôt have a history of hypos or gestational diabetes. I‚Äôm looking for ways to appeal so that I can get coverage.

I was also curious about whether people who have been on a semaglutide ever go off their meds? I‚Äôve read that most are considered to be lifelong drugs, which I shouldn‚Äôt be freaked out about given that I do take bp meds and now a statin to lower my LDL. I don‚Äôt take any other meds to manage diabetes and I have been labeled ‚Äúwell controlled,‚Äù given that I lowered my A1c through diet and exercise.",3,9,2025-07-12T19:39:35,diabetes_t2,https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes_t2/comments/1ly1d2t/wegovy_and_risk_of_hypos/,0.67,True,/r/diabetes_t2/comments/1ly1d2t/wegovy_and_risk_of_hypos/

Last month my period was a few days late.  This month I haven't had my period yet, I'm 11 days late and I'm not pregnant (I've done the test).  I found a rat study on ozempic that says:
""In females, an increase in oestrus cycle length was observed at all dose levels, together with a small reduction in numbers of corpora lutea at ‚â•0.03 mg/kg/day.

1gn6ecj,poppingcandylights,Urinating more often confusion,"Hi everyone!

I'm currently on 4x metformin, 1 x sitagliptin and 1x semaglutide daily for my diabetes, and have been for about 2 months now (metformin for almost a year, added the others more recently).

Since starting the semaglutide and sitagliptin, I've also had a bit of a breakthrough in terms of my BED and haven't binged since! I'm exercising most days and mostly eating very well (with some treats, sure, but not a lot and nowhere near every day any more).

I've lost around a stone and have more energy, my clothes fit more loosely, etc.

All this to say that it is possible that my sugars are stil going up, but I think it's fairly unlikely they would be increasing significantly? However, in the last week I've been having to get up to pee every night (though not noticed any more frequency during the day). Does anyone have any idea about why that could be if it isn't my sugars? Or whether my sugars could still be increasing?

I have never peed this much in 3ish years of being diabetic, even when my sugars were at their highest level (before starting medication).

For context, my daily meals at the moment are usually something along the lines of:

Breakfast: no added fat and sugar Greek yoghurt with mixed seeds and berries/pear/some other fruit

Lunch: tuna and cheddar sandwich with light mayo on seeded bread and assorted salad (usually cucumber, tomato, spring onion and/or carrot)

Snacks: maybe some lentil or multi-grain crisps, often baked, and a piece of fruit

Dinner: chilli with added veg such as spinach and mushrooms, wholemeal pasta

Sometimes a small portion of dessert such as bread and butter pudding, sometimes fruit.

(I know having dessert isn't ideal, but at the moment having these treats is the only way I can stave off the urge to binge when it hits, and the therapist I'm working with on the BED thinks it's a necessary step in my recovery.)

Thank you so much for your thoughts! I hope this post is ok - I'm not asking for medical advice, I guess just wondering if anyone has had anything similar on the same meds/knows why else it could be! I'm definitely not pregnant, and my kidney levels were fine at the last blood test.",2,27,2024-11-09T14:53:11,diabetes_t2,https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes_t2/comments/1gn6ecj/urinating_more_often_confusion/,0.75,True,/r/diabetes_t2/comments/1gn6ecj/urinating_more_often_confusion/

It is called semaglutide ([Ozempic](https://www.healthline.com/health/cdi/ozempic))

Seems like overkill and I have read all kinds of bad things about Ozempic.  I am not overweight and have no other health issues and am very physically fit.

The vicious cycle of insulin resistance and Œ≤-cell dysfunction cannot be untangled without acting on both processes. .\[Research on\] selective insulin sensitizers such as selective PPARŒ≥ agonists, FOXO1 inhibitors  FGF19 and FGF21 and germane mechanisms is limited. Paradigm-altering treatments of Œ≤-cell dysfunction targeting dedifferentiation, senescence, and metabolic inflexibility have received little attention outside academic environments. \[These\] are promising areas that can lead to disease modification or reversal and should be pursued more vigorously than they currently are \[...\]",13,3,2025-04-19T02:34:01,diabetes_t2,https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes_t2/comments/1k2flrk/review_paper_on_insulin_resistance_in_type_2/,0.99,True,/r/diabetes_t2/comments/1k2flrk/review_paper_on_insulin_resistance_in_type_2/

I rarely see folks that actually did manage to get their DM2 under control, I only see the worst of cases and outcomes.

They said they were prescribing oral semaglutide -- I specifically asked if it would be okay with keto, and they said yes.

When I collected the prescription, it was for dapagliflozin -- brand name forxiga or farxiga.

Reading the info, it looks like keto is off the menu, and I need to really stay on top of my hydration or risk ketoacidosis.

I'm so confused. Obviously I plan to stay hydrated on keto, but the whole point is that I struggle to organise myself, so obviously I'd rather minimize any drastic health effects.

1h0vslk,jkraige,Advice for T2 diabetic seeking to get pregnant?,"I was diagnosed a couple years ago with a1c of 6.7 but have kept it to 6.2-6.3 with diet and exercise. In spite of working out several times a week (weight training, spin classes, sometimes boxing and swimming, etc), I'm still pretty obese (BMI like 39/40 for reference) and haven't lost weight in a long time, and I regained what I originally lost anyway, but because I lowered my a1c my doctor hasn't insisted on medication (fwiw my cholesterol is good). 

However, I would like to have a baby in the near future and I realize that starting medication is probably a good idea but I'm not sure if wegovy or metformin would be best. I talked to my doctor and it seemed like the decision was partially about my timeline, and honestly it was my PCP so baby making is just not her area of expertise and I'm not sure I could see a specialist any time soon to ask. But I'm in my 30s and my husband is in his late 30s and I'd have to be off wegovy at least a couple months before trying to conceive, so basically the question is, **is it worth trying to go on wegovy for ~3-6 months  to lose some weight and lower my numbers?** With metformin I could just continue the medication into pregnancy so I wouldn't have the same delay, not to mention I'd probably be put on it anyway during pregnancy since pregnancy tends to make diabetes worse. **Have folks seen a big difference in their weight/numbers in just 3-6 months of taking semaglutides?** 

My husband is pretty worried about my weight and the risks associated with it, but I'm working out and I'm eating better than I ever have and I've just struggled to lose weight for a long time. I know metformin helps some people lose weight, but I'm really quite heavy. I just don't know if a few months of wegovy would make enough of a difference to make up for how much I'd have to delay the start of trying to conceive and I'm curious if anyone has experience with this issue.

Edit: if there's another sub that would be better suited for this question, please let me know. I'm really just trying to stop wasting time coming to a decision.

Im about 20 yrs old at about 256 lbs and about a week or two ago I was diagnosed with diabetes by my primary doctor. I had an a1c of 6.7.My depression got the better of me. I am currently trying to mourn this, I cried a bit and some, but man am I a bit sad and stressed still. I am watching a lot of what I eat, but even in my place theres not a lot to eat. A lot of foods have carbs, and ever since I was young carbs are what I eat. Yknow, pasta, rice, those things. 

Lately, Ive been feeling so abnormal since the diagnosis yknow. Before the diagnosis I felt no worries buying a sugary drink.The condition is all on my mind. Eating feels so stressful and dull.  And I love food. Im feeling weaker than usual, my chest feels heavy all the time, my head hurts when I eat too many carbs I think. Ive read around and I will try heading to an endo soon to grasp more about my body, but I barely have the money these days, I will still do my best to afford to go. 

Im not sure what this post is about... maybe a bit of a vent about my worries. Having to keep consistent about what I eat all the time with a CGM sounds kinda annoying, Im sorry you all have to deal with that. I heard such dreadful things come about diabetes, losing ligaments, getting blind, even Anthony telling us we are more likely for a heart attack or stroke. I regret my eating choices so much..

14ro2cf,sneakykitty,Shocking first A1C update!,"I was diagnosed back at the end of March this year and I was very sick. My A1C was 14! Blood sugars of 300+ average. I took this very seriously as I had seen what type 1 did to my grandma. And I know type 1 and type 2 are two very different beasts, I did not want to have to give myself insulin as well as not wanting any other medical problems from this. I was given metformin 2000mg/day and glipizide. After a month I asked to be on Ozempic to help with weight loss(was given Wegovy at first, but thats another story, now on Ozempic lol) So I was taken off glipizide and started the semaglutide injections. (which aren't so bad needle wise!)

The first night I checked my sugars it was 385. I made dramatic changes to my diet. No sugary drinks, cut most carbs, ate more chicken/tuna. Only drinking zero sugar sodas every now and then, drinking mostly flavored water with zero sugar flavors.

 The fall from 385 was not easy. I felt horribly sick as if I was going hypoglycemic. Ofc I was not, but my body had been at those levels for a while. My vision had changed drastically, going from not being able to see farther things, to not being able to see up close, to being able to see just fine, to now needing my original prescription glasses. I developed a kidney stone around a month in as well so a lot of medical issues hitting all at once. 

If we eat fast food I cut things in half and eat small portions through out the day. I loved discovering sugar free foods because I felt so devastated at the beginning about losing all my favorite foods/drinks. My favorite is sugar free chocolates and Milo's sugar free sweet tea! A real treat as they taste no different than regular chocolates and sweet tea. For exercise I mostly walked. 

Today I had my checkup to test my A1C again. I was expecting 7-8 as I did have some moments of weakness... and bread. It was 5.7!! Still ""pre diabetic"" range but I am so very happy! I will get this under control! I am going up in mg. for my Ozempic and if all goes well I will be lowering my metformin next month when I see my doctor again. Sorry for wall of text haha just so excited!

1ettvql,Rja12345,Blood sugar levels are high but I‚Äôm having a hard time changing,"I got diagnosed two years ago. In that time frame I‚Äôve had ups and downs. I went keto for 3 months at some point and saw the best numbers I‚Äôve ever seen for myself. After those first few months I was dealing with powerful emotions and I gave in to my cravings. For more context I have CPTSD and I have an anxiety disorder so I am constantly having to deal with a roller coaster of emotions which causes emotional eating. Due to my childhood trauma I‚Äôve used food to cope my whole life. 

These past few weeks I‚Äôve been dealing with a lot of stress due to my roommate moving out and rent increases. Im always broke now because of how expensive my rent is and I‚Äôm having a hard time finding a better paying job. I‚Äôve been eating so poorly and i am now starting to see the effects. I never have any energy. My lack of energy is causing me to just sit on my phone all day because I can‚Äôt get myself to do anything productive. It feels like my high levels are making my executive dysfunction issues worse. 

Even cooking and going to the grocery store has been hard for me. I‚Äôve been journaling to dive deeper into my eating habits because no matter how much I try to change my eating habits, if I don‚Äôt do any inner work and figure out my deeply rooted issues I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever be able to change. After a binge the other day my levels were almost at 300 and I‚Äôm so ashamed of myself. I know the consequences and long term issues that come with this but it feels like I can‚Äôt stop. Just wanted to vent and also get some advice from anyone that was able to change their eating habits with underlying issues with emotional eating. 

I have a ksafe (kitchen safe lock) and my last resort is to just lock my debit card into the ksafe so I have no choice but to cook and eat what‚Äôs at home. Unfortunately therapy is not an option for me right now because of money.

znqoct,Al_Bundy71,Scary Steady Rise in A1C but nothing I know of is different ... ANY experience with this,"Brevity is not a gift I have but I am really frustrated/upset/scared and wonder if this has happened to anybody else here. Briefly:

Diagnosed with T2 Diabetes July 2021 (runs on both sides of the family) as a 51M with an A1C of 11.4!!! First A1C test ever...

July 2021 - A1C is 11.4, prescribed gradual 2000 mg of Metformin HCL ER (starting with 1000), taken at night, .5 mg Semaglutide injection once a week  
October 2021 - A1C is 6.5 - ALL IS WELL ... the meds really must be working!  
Jan 2022 - A1C is 6.3 - wonderful  
July 2022 - A1C is 8.2 - dr. had me wait 6 months ... really off the rails  
Oct 2022 - A1C is 9.4 - I was really down ... Semaglutide up to 1 G a week no adverse effects  
Jan 2022 - A1C is 10.0 !! With the Metformin and Semaglutide. I have definitely lost weight but don't know if that's good ... at least 10 lb ... probably because I am scared

I have no symptoms of high blood sugar (which makes it more dangerous) unless sleepy around noon counts but I have never been the best sleeper. Stress is pretty bad but at least consistent. I don't 'pee a lot' but likely don't drink enough either as I don't thirst in general. MAYBE I don't exercise as much but I still do my morning walks (haven't been to my gym since COVID). Would returning to yoga, kickboxing, and strength training help? I was doing kickboxing virtually during my 'good numbers' 3x a week come to think of it. Could that be it??? Just that?

Silly questions ... do the meds 'wear off' after a while and need to be changed up? I am pretty terrified as I had hoped my A1C would drop to 7s at least but nope.  

Something is very obviously wrong. I am seeing my doctor on Monday and am freaked out. Has anybody seen 'my story' before and care to share what happened? Really stressing out over here ... which is also not good for blood sugar.

14elafh,Library_IT_guy,I went in for my 6 month checkup today expecting the worst...,"And instead I had my lowest A1C reading ever - 5.0. 

I was diagnosed with an A1C of 13.7 in December 2021. 2022 was a bit of a rollercoaster as we tried different meds, and I tried various things like exercise and diet and low carb and restricted calorie and I was generally just miserable and depressed. My readings were around 7, then up to 10, then down to 6, and then today I hit 5. 

Thing is, I don't feel like I earned this at all. I eat less than I used to. I've lost 50 lbs and I'm still losing. But my diet is pretty poor. Fast food a few times a week which includes fries and breaded chicken. A small bowl of soup for lunch usually, which has probably 20-30 carbs in it. I've had cookies. I just took a week off work to binge a new game and I was the worst diabetic you can imagine during that week. I ate things like Doritos, a sub from a sub shop, a casserole filled with carbs, etc. I'm eating like half of what I used to because the meds I'm on cut my appetite down, but still... the quality of what I'm eating...

I'm just in shock. How can I be this low? Don't get me wrong - I'm ecstatic. My eye doc was super happy with my progress as well (had some vision problems), and I couldn't understand how his diagnosis was so good either, considering what I've been eating. 

I'm currently on 1000mg of Metformin, 4mg of Glimepiride, and and the standard dose of Rybelsus (which is a semaglutide and i think the key to my success), daily. I eat pretty much what I want, within reason, though the key is that I just don't want anywhere near as much as I used to when I eat. I go for a short walk in the evening but that's all I've been doing for exercise. 

I was dreading this appointment so much, but turns out I'm doing just fine.

Currently taking 3 meds for type 2, anyone else taking a combination of these 3? Today is day 1 of taking all 3, no major side effects. I did experience a massive bowel movement. 

Thank goodness my insurance covered a massive portion of Ozempic, that stuff is EXPENSIVE without. Definitely going to start making life changes such as exercising at least 4 times a week. My diet is horrible, but I definitely need to make a change in that also. 

Prognosis is that my doctor will monitor me for 6 months and once he sees me as stabilized and that my glucose and A1C lowers to normalized amounts,  we can discuss removing some medications. 

I was dealing with having extreme thirst and peeing more than I thought was usual, so I asked the doctor if we could do an A1C and I gotta admit I was not shocked that I had type 2, but rather shocked it was so high!

17nsecf,Library_IT_guy,This disease is so weird sometimes. Ate carbs and had... a low?,"I don't normally eat breakfast and I often skip lunch too. Semaglutide just makes me not hungry, what can I say. Well as its Saturday, I decided to have some breakfast. I had fried potatoes, bacon, and eggs. I know, carbs bad, but my a1c was 5.0 and I never go over 180 after eating.

So lately I've been having bad diarrhea. It's not due to metformin - I dropped that a while back with my doctor's blessing. Most likely just IBD. Well that happened this morning so I took some Imodium. Got it out of my system. OK, think I'm good now, time to take a shower and get on with my day. As I'm drying off I get shaky, feel weak, and I can feel a low coming on. 

Now I just ate freaking potatoes. Surely not, right? But I checked... and I was at 46 bg level. I've hit 50 before but 46...   SHEESH. 40s is danger zone. Double checked to make sure... same reading. Oddly I still don't feel hungry. I mean I just ate like an hour or two ago. 

So I had a chocolate bar. I'm good now, sitting st 80. Have to go buy more emergency carbs because that was my last one. It's just crazy to me that this happened. I'm only on glimepiride and rybelsus. No insulin.

My doctor told me she's not putting me on any medication, but she wants me to lose weight (fucking duh), as well a getting an eye exam once a year and seeing a podiatrist once a year. She's also referring me to an endocrinologist to rule out T1 diabetes. I've been working with a dietician for several months and I have been to my local diabetes education centre.

I‚Äôve been put on semaglutide‚Äîamazing impact already‚Äîand am continuing using the Libre 3 to track and monitor blood sugars. The nighttime hypoglycemias have mostly stopped and my blood sugars are now hovering around 100 mg/dL fairly well. Family members with T1D are a tad jealous of how controlled I am now.

So far the insurance companies are being pretty awful since I‚Äôm not quite sick enough. The rejections are that basically. So my medications are not being covered. \[EDIT to clarify, the struggle is getting semaglutide covered, so far they are willing to pay for the CGM\]

1dp52xj,sskarupa,Ozempic denied after bringing down A1c.. WTF!,"<rant - tilting against windmills time>

So my wife has T2 and was prescribed Ozempic about a year ago.  It did wonders for her, dropped her A1c from the 7's down to well below 6, she lost a bunch of weight and it even impacted her cholesterol numbers as well.   Life is pretty good.  She doesn't even test her self all that often because the numbers are almost always within range.

Fast forward about a year and all of a sudden, the insurance company denies her refill.   They are saying that her A1c is no longer in the range to require the medication.  What?!?!?!   The whole reason she's taking it is because it's been so effective at reducing her A1c!   That's the point of the medication!  Who is making the decisions over there - morons?   It's not like her diabetes has been magically cured by the medication - it's just a maintenance tool.

Her doctor tried to fight the decision, but they aren't budging and she's just sorta giving up - I'm sure there are ways to really dig in and fight for it, but she's planning to just go back to diet, exercise, and good ol' gut mucking Metformin.   So now she has to let the A1c climb back up above some magic threshold, risk permanent damage to her health and then she can try to get it prescribed again.   Then once it comes back down, they'll deny it again, and around and around we go on the insurance denial wheel.   Seriously unreal.  

So sick of the health care system.

Has anyone been on both of these medication‚Äòs? 

I was diagnosed as a type two diabetic four years ago and initially was only on oral medication 1 g of long-acting metformin twice a day and my A1c and sugars came down within normal range but since I contacted Covid back in 2022 I was having issues with my sugar going up or it could‚Äôve been the metformin kicking out as well which it can do so they put me on Ozempic. 

I started on .25 and Over a seven or eight month period Got to a milligram but I was having a lot of symptoms very much gastric and no appetite whatsoever!

 I don‚Äôt know if I was taking in 800 cal a day. I initially was not on it for weight loss although I had hoped to lose some weight did not lose a pound but could not seem to get above .5 mg without experiencing too many symptoms. 


I do have a history of Crohn‚Äôs disease in  remission, but I do have IBS from time to time And I just found that I was nauseated burping my bowels were messed up. Could barely take anything to eat, no matter how hard I tried and how many times I tried to eat I just felt generally unwell, very fatigued and dizzy so my doctor and I made the decision to take me off for a while And I was started on Jardience  10 mg as well as the metformin and I am fine with that. 

The metformin did not give me any gastric side effects as I switched to the long acting form so I know it wasn‚Äôt that but my plan does cover Mounjaro and I‚Äôm wondering about trying that. Has anyone tried that as opposed to Ozempic and are the side effects any better?

1lzv0uk,Former-Complaint-336,"Is wanting to jump right to a CGM dramatic for my situation? ARFID, OZEMPIC AND DIETING.","Hey yall. Long post, sorry about it. 

 I am recently diagnosed just 2 months ago. I started on metformin right away and 2 weeks ago started ozempic. Doc hasn't even recommended getting a monitor and starting finger pokes yet, but I had a pretty bad low for the first time the other day so I'm def planning on getting one after my next appt next month. 

I'm trying to work on food stuff but its really hard for me because I suffer from ARFID, if you dont know, its an eating disorder that is like intense picky eating/ phobia of trying new foods. If something doesn't feel/taste ""safe"" to me, it literally makes me gag and often I cannot swallow or even vomit. This happens with many veggies, some fruits, I'm a vegetarian so no meat, beans are mushy and freak me out.  I have always eaten mostly processed crap and carbs. Bread and cheese in all its many forms, smoothies and protein shakes. Trying new things like veggies/ meat replacements/ ethnic foods, literally gives me anxiety attacks. Going out to eat is really hard even before diabetes. 

  
Since starting ozempic I have been logging all my food, measuring portions,  drastically increased my fiber, protein, and water intake and lowered my calories. I'm working on the carbs, definitely doing a way better job than before I started logging, and have made some big cuts to lots of things I used to eat. Currently only over my carb allowance by less than 15g at most of my meals. Which is wayyyy better than how I was doing before. I'm also just eating a lot less in general thanks to the appetite suppression, I'm not really counting calories but I'm definitely eating like 800-1000 less than before just from decreased snacking. (Still getting almost/to 2000, not starving myself lol) 

  
One of the big steps I need to take is to change up my diet to include more non processed things. I honestly don't see myself DRASTICALLY changing my whole diet because of my disorder, but I really need to add in some whole foods somehow. One of the only veggie dishes I like is stir fry, but thats not exactly low carb, especially with the noodles. I like peppers raw, thats about it. Cooked onions and peppers, some zucchini dishes, some eggplant parm, some pasta with tomatos, peppers, onions. I'm trying to get into tofu, I found one dish I like it in but its also not low carb, its got honey and brown sugar in the sauce for the tofu bites. I've been so traumatized by bad food experiences I'm so fucking scared to try anything new.

  
I've been reading about CGM's a lot, and I'm really thinking they might be a good solution for me, that way I can experiment with my ""safe"" foods, see what makes me really spike and which are manageable in moderation, as well as try new foods and see how they react. I think it would be a really useful tool in managing my ARFID, Diabetes, AND my ozempic diet all in one. But is it dramatic to want to go immediately to one of those when I've never even done an at home finger poke test? Will my doctor make me suffer through months of finger pokes before prescribing me a cgm? Just with my schedule I will find it so hard to test 2 hrs after eating like you're supposed to all the time, I would have to bring it to work and do it in the bathroom twice a day, it would be so much simpler to have the constant monitor. 

Anyway, thoughts? Any other diabetics with ARFID that have tips or anything that helped you branch out?",6,32,2025-07-15T00:23:40,diabetes_t2,https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes_t2/comments/1lzv0uk/is_wanting_to_jump_right_to_a_cgm_dramatic_for_my/,0.75,True,/r/diabetes_t2/comments/1lzv0uk/is_wanting_to_jump_right_to_a_cgm_dramatic_for_my/

My goal is to get off of the medication for good.  I want my 5.5 A1C again. I am in the 8's. I will be exercising (walking very slowly) 2 miles a day 3 times a week and my calories are 1400 a day.  This is normal to weigh 130 lbs.

What is your best advice for a newbie taking Ozempic (good/bad)? I didn't want to change from my Trulicity.  My A1C used to be 12.3. Now, it is in the 8-9 range.

I have Heart Failure, I had an ICD implanted.  I haven't moved for awhile due to medical issues. I have kidney disease.  I am fighting back from all of this. Every person's journey is different. Trying to overcome BED, losing weight, getting in shape, and attacking my A1C is overwhelming. I don't have a choice.

For context, He asked me to administer it to him. Upon seeing the prescription which is 1mg once weekly and 4 boxes were prescribed. When I saw the box it says 1mg so we thought it is a one box of 1mg knowing upon research that 0.25mg is the initial dose. So I thought maybe we will administer this all at once. So we cleaned the site and I rotated to 1mg. After that I notice that the cartridge still look full and thought maybe the medicine was not administered. So I asked my father in law again about what the doctor told him that the 4 boxes are for 1 month (now I‚Äôm not sure if this is what really the doctor said) so he said to administer it again, and stupid me complied, and this is when I saw the cartridge move and I realized it is possible he double dose now.

Now, after 12 hrs he is vomiting and have some GI discomfort. How long will this last? I am worried as he has anxiety and type 2 diabetes.

I am extremely sensitive to the product I gather as I am on each dose for over eight weeks until I go to the next dose and it seems like when I go above .5 my symptoms are intolerable. 

Even staying on the .5 I find that instead of my symptoms getting better overtime I seem to be getting worse. 

The nausea is horrible until about day six I have reflux beyond belief. I have loose stools and abdominal cramping off and on some weeks are better than others. I have tried to eat smaller meals. I‚Äôve tried to watch what I eat, but it‚Äôs very difficult. I also find that I‚Äôm extremely fatigued because I‚Äôm not taking enough calories and that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm so tired and I‚Äôve not lost any weight on it, but I was taking it primarily for blood sugar control which it was excellent at doing.

1jt8loj,Kindly-Discipline-53,Eating on Ozempic,"Last July, my A1C was 12.0 even though I was on Metformin and Glipizide. I asked about Ozempic and I was told that my insurance wouldn't pay for it unless I got my A1C below 10. My doctor's office has a pair of nurse managers who have been very helpful. They put me on insulin and gave me a continuous glucose monitor, and in November, my A1C was 8.5. (I credit the CGM for my increased control of my BG.)

In December, I started on Ozempic and once it was shown that I had no side effects, I started lowering the insulin doses. While I was on both, I had frequent problems with hypoglycemia but I learned how to treat them and prevent them. I've been off the insulin for about a month, and I usually have no problem with the Ozempic and staying in the green zone. In fact, I was tested two days ago and my A1C was 5.8.

However, every once in a while (like today), I get a bit of hypoglycemia. The thing is that the Ozempic affects my appetite in such a way that I don't want to eat anything even though my blood sugar is low. I do have glucose tablets, but they don't exactly do anything about protein, etc.

\[ETA (Inserting this here for context): The day I posted this, my CGM had notified me that my BG was falling and I would be below 70 soon. I checked my BG and it was 72 so I took 4 glucose tablets. I checked my BG 15 minutes later and it was 74, so I took 4 more glucose tablets, but I felt that I should eat something more substantial. However, I was feeling full and didn't really want to eat anything. Thus the following question.\]

11zjdzx,plazman30,"My Ozempic Rant, Part 2","I ranted before on how I was annoyed that people were taking Ozempic for weight loss and risking thyroid cancer rather than actually put some effort into losing weight. I got some nasty comments from people telling me that I don't know everyone's situation, and I should not be so quick to judge.

My local pharmacy bought a huge supply of Ozempic and has been able to keep me supplied. When I picked up my last dose, he told me he's blown through his entire supply and he may not be able to fill next month's prescription. The number of prescriptions he's had to fill has more than quadrupled over the last 3 months.

Well, last weekend I found out the problem isn't that people want Ozempic to lose weight.  It's the doctors.

My wife and I had dinner with a bunch of friends. EVERY ONE OF THEM had the doctor offer them Ozempic for weight loss.

One friend needed to lose 20 pounds. She told the doctor this. And the guy immediately wrote her an Ozempic prescription.

Another friend is a T1 Diabetic, and 40+ years of insulin injection has made him put on some serious weight. The doctor told him he needed to lose 50 pounds. So he said, he's going to do keto. The last time he did it, he lost about 30 pounds and he cut the amount of insulin he used more than in half. The doctor tells him to not suffer with keto and just take Ozempic instead.

His wife used to be grossly overweight.  Shed has successfully lost over 100 pounds already and is continuing to lose weight every week. But the doctor wants her on Ozempic cause he thinks that will improve her weight loss.

Other friends were also immediately offered Ozempic when they told their doctor they wanted to lose a little weight.

8 people sitting around a table, and all 8 were offered Ozempic by their doctor. None of them are Type 2 diabetics. None of them asked for Ozempic.

And, from what I am seeing in scientific literature, once you stop taking Ozempic, most, if not all, the weight comes back. So, each of these people is now an Ozempic customer for life.

So now I'm kinda pissed at doctors. I don't think a pharmaceutical intervention for weight loss should be the first thing you suggest to a patient, even when they're already successfully losing weight, or want to try something else.

I'm a T2 diabetic and my doctor never offered me Ozempic. I had to ask him about it.  And he didn't just write the prescription. He told me the risks and benefits, and told me think about it till our next meeting.",67,121,2023-03-23T18:19:50,diabetes_t2,https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes_t2/comments/11zjdzx/my_ozempic_rant_part_2/,0.86,True,/r/diabetes_t2/comments/11zjdzx/my_ozempic_rant_part_2/
1i7ukn8,YourCryptoMom,Doctor will not prescribe Ozempic even with high readings,"Hello! I  (F 51) was diagnosed with T2 5 years ago with a 7.0 AIC.  Did not take things seriously and in 2022, I hit a 9.4 AIC.  I tried Metformin later in 2022 and I had the usual stomach issues and quit taking it 7 months later.  Without meds, I am down to 6.4, mostly from diet.  I have high readings throughout the day. Some examples:   I had 4 oz of broiled chicken breast with half a cup of brown rice and an hour later I was 245.  Several times a week, my morning fasting numbers are between 160 and 180 and never under 140. (Note, I don't usually do brown rice or anything super carby for that matter)

  
My doctor said that because it seems I'm doing ""wonderful"" on my own, he doesn't think I need any medication. I should also add that my BMI is 43, down from 46.  I feel like even though my AIC may seem ""normal"", my numbers throughout the day are not. 

Are these numbers damaging my body? Is there anything I can do to convince my doctor that I need help? Do I need a new doctor?

Anyway, since being diagnosed, I was put on Jardiance and insulin initially (and cholesterol and BP medicine). Stopped the insulin a few weeks ago and switched to Metformin. I started eating very low carb, whole foods, ramped up steps to an average of 13k/day and have been 98% in the green on my cgm since I got it. I‚Äôve fluctuated 8-10lbs weight loss but my doctor wants me to lose more. Especially the belly fat!

Although a minor risk, what else do we not know about these new miracle drugs. It's hard to fool mother nature.  Lower BG may be one of the most important marker for health, but it isn't the only thing we need to be concerned about. Medication is important for those who are seriously ill to stay alive, but this new trend of long term drug use that supposedly will extend our lives so long as we keep taking them seems like a fountain of youth scam.

I won't dispute the short term use of GLP-1 drugs, but the reality is most people last about two years on them, and those who use it for weight loss unfortunately regain most of it when they stop using. 

Not trying to dissuade people from using it, but we need to realize that it's only good as a start.

16a2dco,mark4_9,Are metformin and ozempic side effects worth it.,"Looking for your experience and/or thoughts here.

Why wouldn't I opt for long lasting insulin use over metformin and ozempic use that the side effects (thought typical) are just crappy to deal with?

Some back story...

50/m

I have been taking metformin for about 5 years dosages from 500 to 1500 mg aday depending on side effects vs benefits (per directed by Dr). Three years ago I was mildly sick with a virus 3 times in a time span of 4 months, since then my torence to metformin has been terrible but still taking 1000 mg aday.

About a year ago ozempic .25 then .5 was added to my pills and potions. The ozempic has/had it's own side effects that at times seem to get better but never gone...

To make the story short, fast forward.....  To 3 weeks ago, I ran out of ozempic, 5 days ago I ran out of metformin.

My BS has been terrible, no lie... But the side effects from those drugs have gone all but away, and how great that is.

Now I have started my meds again, and the side effects have started again..

Thus my question,  why wouldn't I opt for insulin use over these side effects??",17,95,2023-09-05T01:33:46,diabetes_t2,https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes_t2/comments/16a2dco/are_metformin_and_ozempic_side_effects_worth_it/,0.91,True,/r/diabetes_t2/comments/16a2dco/are_metformin_and_ozempic_side_effects_worth_it/

1flyar4,ninfamaniac,Meds that help with weight loss that aren't Ozempic or Mounjaro,"Hi

I just wondered if there are any diabetic medications that can help with weight loss that aren't Ozempic or Mounjaro? Or Metformin as I'm on that and want to come off due to side effects.

My weightloss has stalled for the past 4 months and I take a lot of medication for other issues which I can't change. 

The way things work in the country where I have my healthcare is that the GP cannot prescribe diabetes meds and it has to be done through the Diabetes team. My GP has already expressed her disdain for people taking Ozempic and Mounjaro for weight loss but ultimately it's not down to her. 

I'm just curious if there's anything else? I mean I'll take what I'm given and I'm not averse to taking Ozempic or Mounjaro. In fact I would be very happy to. Just... is there anything else?

I'm starting to think, your body only burns fat when your body is in that fasting range of 70-100,  Normal people are in the fasting range hours after eating, which make it easier for them to lose weight.  A lot of diabetics never get below 100 even with meds, which make it harder for us to lose weight.

About 15 months ago, I was diagnosed with T2.  My A1c was at 11.9, my weight was at 280 (5'9"" male). My Dr. started me on Metformin.  Meanwhile I completely changed my diet and exercise (mostly keto) and I started to see results.  However, Metformin made me sick, so about 6 months ago, my doctor moved me over to Ozempic.  That provided the shot I needed.  My weight went down to 185 and my A1c was last recorded at 5.0!  I was really happy and hopeful that I could keep this disease at bay and get healthier.  

Unfortunately, my insurance company decided that they were not going to cover Ozempic anymore.  They didn't even give me an explanation (at least not yet).  Now I'm down to my last 2 weeks of doses and am scared to death that I'm going to soon undo everything I've worked so hard to attain.

Has anyone else been in this situation?  What can I expect?  Will I get withdrawls?  Will I start gaining back all the weight?  Will my A1c climb back up?  I'm so dissapointed this is happening.  Any advice or experiences are welcome.

Any tricks on how to deal with it? I can‚Äôt really tell if I am hungry at all right now, also I end up vomiting after eating, so things have been a bit hard on me. 

I‚Äôll try some Iberogast and hope that helps, but I am open for any and everything to get the vomiting to stop at least.

17z3bmo,Ghitit,Long Ozempic rant,"This is a huge rant.   Please pardon grammar errors.     

I was diagnosed earlier this year (Feb. '23) I'm on 500mg o of Metformin, 2x daily, which seems to be working well

I am also on Atorvastatin for high blood pressure, three medications for my A-fib.

I am 66 y/o;  5'8"", 260 lbs. I've lost 20lbs since I started taking Metformin. I've bee about 250 for almost twenty years. I got down to 200 when I was 50, but gradually it climbed back up. At my highest I was 283. Covid weight.

I have joint pain in my legs and feet.

Many of my symptoms are a result of my weight.

They give me meds for my heart issue; they give me meds for my high cholesterol; they give me meds for my diabetes - all supposedly in conjunction with diet and exercise they are prescribed to help with these conditions. And they're working. All of my numbers are down. Yay.

But when it comes to my weight they won't prescribe me the one thing that can seriously help me with the weight. Everyone has been looking forward to a medication that can help people with weight loss, right?

The weight is what the major problem .

My cardiologist has done a bunch of tests as to why my breathing is difficult when I go up the stairs or walk a block. All were good. He told me I have to lose weight. That's the thing that will help me most of all.

I wrote to my PCP and told her I want to try Ozempic for a bit to lose weight and help my glucose numbers. I would like get out of the pre-diabetic number range. I thought that was the goal.

My PCP wasn't available and I saw the physicians assistant.

She told me that my glucose numbers are really good (115-150) and that I should not worry about them at all as long as I keep doing what I'm doing. She said my A1C at 5.9 is excellent for a T2. That was a big surprise to me.

The PA said that my liver numbers, specifically Alkaline Phosphatase @ 127, with their cut off level to high is 123, which makes it only very slightly over the line ranging in to high range. (previously it was 135) All of my other lab numbers are within the normal range.

She stressed that Ozempic can damage the liver and the pancreas. I didn't realize that that. From what she said, that it was a common side effect, and I agreed that Ozempic might be wrong for me.

Oh, and what else did I read...? I googled ""Causes for high liver numbers"" And two of the answers were, yup, obesity and diabetes.

sigh

So one of the possible causes of elevated liver numbers is obesity, but they won't help me with losing weight.

They also haven't shown any interest in finding out why my liver numbers are sightly elevated.

I have since done a bit of googling and found out that the APL range number varies from lab to lab.. Some labs make the ""high"" cutoff at 147, not 123; which would make my 127 number not in the high range but within the normal range. Also, that the pancreatic damage side effect is a rare side effect - not a common one as the PA implied.

It seemed to me that the PA simply didn't want to prescribe the Ozempic to me and to have me to just lose weight. She suggested I see the nutritionist so I can be ""accountable"" to someone else.

If I can get a drug to help me bring down my triglycerides - in conjunction with diet and exercise, and a drug to bring down my heart rate, in conjunction with diet and exercise, and a drug to bring down my glucose level, in conjunction with diet and exercise, why won't they give me a drug that can help me lose weight, in conjunction with diet and exercise, - something that I've had little success with over the past thirty years,

All of my conditions are weight related. But they won't they give me the new medication that can help me be able to lose weight?

Is it because obesity is one of the most reviled conditions in human existence? Without knowing anything else about you, being fat makes you immediately loathed by much, if not the majority, of the population.

They think, ""She must be lazy and lack self control."" I have ADHD and I definitely lack self control. But, as per my PA, there are no medications that are not stimulant that can help ADHD sufferers in a meaningful way. Stimulants are the best medication for that condition. But since I can't take stimulants because of my Atrial fibrillation I'm shit out of luck.

Alcoholics and and drug addicts c get more empathy than fat people.  

I would like to live the last ten (hopefully) years of my life at a normal weight

It was my understanding that the Ozempic was what was actually keeping my A1C (especially my fasting numbers) down, as Metformin was never effective in the same way and neither was eating a low carb (<35 net carbs a day) diet for months with exercise.

In the entire time I've been on Ozempic, it really hasn't done anything for me. My blood sugar hasn't really gone down. I get no appetite suppression. And I haven't lost any weight.

Last week the doctor bumped me up to 2 mg. I took the shot at around 10:00 AM on Saturday and also experienced no issues. I was fine all day until around 10:00 PM. Then I started to get some nausea and cramping. Had a BM, and things got better, but then they worse again.

And the nausea has kind of been on and off again since then. I woke up this morning nauseous. But now it's 9:30 AM, and I am feeling fine, though I feel like this problem may come back.  I don't quite feel normal.

I'm assuming this is in relation to the Ozempic, but since I have never had a problem with Ozempic before, I'm not sure.

For the people that experience ""intestinal discomfort"" with Ozempic, how soon after the shot does it happen? Do you get diarrhea also?

1iva2ku,GhostyGirlSlay,Blood sugar spike on Ozempic,"Hey everyone, 
So long story short, I was on Ozempic for a while, worked great, A1C became normal again, insurance stopped covering Ozempic, A1C spiked again, now I have my Ozempic back. 

I was on a 1mg dose prior to insurance taking my Ozempic away and my Dr decided that instead of going through the process of building up tolerance again with the low doses that she would just throw the whole 1mg at me again... And my body absolutely does not like that. I took my first shot today and ever since I have been sick to my stomach, with a headache and every time I check my blood sugar it's well over 200... This is not normal for me as even with an A1C of 9 my glucose reading is rarely over 160. 

Currently, I am wondering if the higher glucose levels is caused by the shock to my system of taking a 1mg dose after not having anything for 6 months? Like, perhaps it caused my glucose to drop too fast and my body is trying to overcompensate? Does that sound ridiculous? I am fully aware that nausea is a common side effect of the medication so I'm not concerned with that but the high glucose level is a whole different beast and just wondering if anyone else has ever dealt with a temporary (I assume it's temporary) increase in blood sugar right after starting Ozempic?

1obvqsz,FarPomegranate7437,My experience with Wegovy,"I just got me A1c back after about 3 months on a GLP-1, and my A1c is even better than it was before I started them meds despite not having exercised as regularly as I should and being a little looser about my diet.

Jan 2025: 7.1
June 2025: 5.3
October 2025: 5

I did put in a lot of hard work including a complete overhaul of my diet and obsessively tracking everything for the first couple of months after diagnosis. I was also exercising from 45-75 minutes per day before my second A1c test. While that is probably how I should be living my life, I found it to be a pretty huge mental load. I saw an endo at the end of June after my second A1c and asked her if she recommended anything to help increase my insulin sensitivity. She put me on Wegovy, which I started in mid July. 

I was super surprised to find my number so great, especially since I haven‚Äôt been exercising very regularly since I threw my back out due to bad side effects from a statin in July. I have been conscious about my diet, but nowhere near as obsessive as I was the first several months. In any case, Wegovy has been a game changer for me, even if it hasn‚Äôt caused me to lose much weight. I‚Äôm in it for the insulin sensitivity more than anything, and it has shown that it does its job in that regard! 

I‚Äôm not suggesting that people take meds, especially if they‚Äôre uncomfortable with them, but I have found it to be a game changer for me, although I am definitely getting back in the gym when I can! I know this doesn‚Äôt mean I can go back to my old lifestyle, but I‚Äôm so glad to have a mental and emotional load taken off my shoulders!

Update:

I‚Äôve been T2 for a while, significantly changed my diet, lost a lot of weight (over 40 pounds), started working out 3 times a week and been on Metformin and Gliclazide but my A1C is still high.

14q3re1,cheezie_machine,Newly Diagnosed. A1C 10.1% Ozempic vs. Wegovy? Normal blood sugar range?,"Last year I was prediabetic with A1C of 6.4%. I didn't change any of my habits and low and behold, putting off the blood test for diabetes led to an A1C of over 10%. I've been taking metformin 750mg for PCOS for almost two years now. I've kept that and added 0.5mg of Ozempic injections once a week. 


I guess my question is, people use wegovy, at a much much higher dose of a whopping 2.4mg, simply for weight loss. I'm wondering, since I'm approved by my insurance, with PCOS, diabetes and obesity; why wouldn't I start the higher dose Wegovy treatments? I've cut out sugary drinks, fast food and heavy carbs (it's been a week since my diagnosis) and my blood sugar with the blood glucose monitor typically stays around 200-230mg/dL with my lowest coming in at 175mg/dL after overnight fasting. 


Is my blood glucose too high to have been 200+ for an entire week? Would this mean I need to increase the metformin or Ozempic? I have a follow up with the doctor in another week and my blood glucose monitor keeps track of my trends via an app so I have that to show.

1nczy2v,YourMomThinksImSexy,What was your journey to diabetes like? Did it surprise you or did you know you were on your way there? What was your life like when you starting having symptoms but didn't know it was diabetes?,"I just got diagnosed with T2. I've always been a big man but fairly fit - 6ft, 205lbs in high school, gradually growing heavier over the last 30 years. I'm currently very out of shape, though still strong and active. I'm built like a slightly pudgier Roy Nelson, from the UFC.

I've eaten terribly my entire adult life - mostly fastfood, a lot of heavy sauces, carbs and soda. Because I was so active and didn't really overeat, I didn't put weight on easily, but it crept up gradually. I was diagnosed with non-alcoholic liver disease in my 40s and I worked hard to get down from 272 to 220. Then I moved to Los Angeles and the weight started to creep back up because I was out eating socially a lot...and then a couple years later when Covid hit, I was living alone in a trailer, alone 99% of the time for months at a time, and I turned to food to distract myself from the loneliness.

My eating habits were bad before, but I always ate in moderation and was very active. Post-Covid, eating my feelings became the norm, and between that and being far less active, I went from around 245 to my current 305 in two years.

I had lots of warning signs, but my doctor didn't seem to be overly concerned with them, telling me that if I ate better and exercised more, I'd lose the weight and be fine (I'm sure that would have been true early on). Because I have advanced ADHD, a history of poor diet, a sedentary job and a family history of diabetes, I figured they would have been more concerned about diabetes, but every time I brought it up, they said my panels looked fine, though a little elevated. I had been telling them of symptoms that seemed diabetes-related (dizziness, vision changes, shakiness, sudden bouts of lethargy, etc), but they said as long as my panels looked good, not to worry.

They kept that same prognosis all the way up until I asked for an A1C test. The symptoms had been getting more pronounced and occurring more often, so I finally demanded the test. Two tests over a few months, both over 7.

I'm a chronic underachiever, bad at routines and worse at self-control (when it comes to food, especially). Back when I was diagnosed with liver disease, the doctor made it abundantly clear that because of my liver issue and severe hypertension, I needed to lose weight, and fast, or I was at a high risk for potential fatal outcomes - I took them seriously and lost the weight. This time around, the doctor never made my weight seem like a life-threatening issue, so I never made a concerted effort to lose weight, just working out here and there and trying (and failing) to change my diet.

It may seem like I'm blaming my doctor (and I am, partially), but I understand it's wholly my fault because of the poor choices I made diet and exercise-wise. I'm just frustrated that my doctor always downplayed the seriousness of my symptoms and didn't push for earlier A1C tests where we might have caught it in the 5 or 6 range.

I just started Wegovy and I'm switching out one meal a day for a vegetable smoothie, and I've stopped soda altogether, and I'm back to exercising four times a week (though not nearly as hard as I used to, because at 53, my body needs a slow ramp up, lol).

1odmhzl,FarPomegranate7437,How long does the GLP-1 honeymoon last?,"I posted something about my experience as a type 2 diabetic on Wegovy a couple of days ago. I just got my c-peptide and fasting insulin test back and am astounded at how much better everything is.

My question to people who have been on various GLP-1s is whether it‚Äôs easy to maintain these kinds of numbers. Does time take its toll and things start creeping up again despite maintaining a good exercise regimen and a low(ish) carb diet or have things stayed the same for you over time?

1k529fr,misterwiser34,Trying to stay Positive- Don't know if I should be livid or not with my PCP team.,"Hey All, 


Just needing to shout into the void. Was officially diagnosed with T2 on Friday. Going thru the usual emotions of anger, guilt, frustration and shame. But what I (38M) can't get over is I feel like I've been screwed over by poor communication and or medical negligence.


 I wont lie - The past 2yrs have been kinda rough for me due to unemployment, loss of insurance, racked up some debt, struggles in my marriage, a foot injury that never healed (occurred pre D diagnosis- but now I cant get needed surgery until my A1C is under control and I couldnt get the surgery earlier because of insurance issues) that have just made me feel like every time I think I'm finally getting back to some stability something else just comes thru to punch me in the teeth. It's frustrating because I know how to be healthy and for most of my life I had been in fairly solid shape and would be considered athletic prior to my weight gain. I now have a pretty great job that I'm good at and I enjoy but now I'm scared I might need to re-evaluate it as it's a high travel gig (50%) that requires me to work nights fairly regularly. I'm worried this could cause severe complications for me as I'm aware it probably caused my diabetes to occur.   

This isn't an excuse ultimately my health is my responsibility i know that, but I guess I just need to write it out for myself. 



I had a follow up appt from my physical with PCP last Friday and he confirmed my worst fears- 13.3 A1C. Fortunately no major complications with my kidneys heart all look good at the moment. My liver isn't great but hopefully my diet changes should fix it.  Started on MF and will be going on G. Doing a low carb diet to start shedding lbs per docs recommendations. 

But I found out when they ran my labs back in late January my A1C was a 9.3. My PCP was out on leave so the practice's NP did the physical. I remember specifically having a conversation with her back then on my concerns about my weight and my recent history of issues that made me scared I was pre-diabetic and asked if I could work with a dietitian and or get on Mojaro/wegovy. Tried to get wegovy, insurance denied. 



 I never got any follow up from the practice in January that stated ""hey dude, you don't have pre-diabetes, you have fucking Diabetes and you need to fix shit NOW.""  Sure, my labs are posted in my portal but I didn't realize when I got the results how serious they were.  And no one ever said to me ""Hey you're diabetic"" until I had my doctor confirm it on Friday. I know he's pretty worried about it because he saw there was 0 communication to me around this. 



To say I'm disappointed is beyond imagination and I feel so defeated.I was so looking forward to finally getting my foot fixed so I could start doing more physical activities again. 


I'm trying to stay positive and have made some serious moves to focus on switching to a healthier lifestyle (bought a gym membership, rower, and currently eating really well) but I feel like I'm at a significant disadvantage especially with my foot. I can't run on it and it's a continuous pain. 

If anyone has any advice I'd love to hear it. ",9,24,2025-04-22T15:09:43,diabetes_t2,https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes_t2/comments/1k529fr/trying_to_stay_positive_dont_know_if_i_should_be/,0.85,True,/r/diabetes_t2/comments/1k529fr/trying_to_stay_positive_dont_know_if_i_should_be/

1k4fwy4,Newslisa,What's happening here?,"Hi all - I was diagnosed in January with an A1C of 10.8. I rebuilt my diet from the ground up, started Metformin and a CGM then, around Valentine's Day, I started on Wegovy. 

For the past 4-6 weeks, my average glucose and GMI had been falling. Three weeks ago, my seven-day average glucose was at 97 and GMI was 5.6-5.7. That held steady until the past week. 

Now, though, my seven-day average is up to 104 and GMI is up to 5.8. My diet has not changed (in fact, the best readings I had were during a week with some dining out cheat meals 10-12 days ago).  

A typical day's menu is plain greek yogurt with berries and stevia for breakfast; a salad with chicken for lunch, with cottage cheese standing in for dressing - no croutons, etc.; and protein plus veg for dinner (grilled or baked chicken, pork or fish with steamed green beans or asparagus or the like). I have one piece of Dove dark chocolate in the evening. I have about 1-3 drinks per week (gin mixed with unsweetened seltzer water - my hillbilly cocktail).

My weight is going down. I keep myself in a 70-130 custom range on the CGM - I was experiencing some briefs dips below 70 in past weeks, but nothing either high or low in the past 7 days - I am 100% in the 70-130 range. 

What's going on? Any advice? Nothing to worry about?

1e3gaas,Gumnutbaby,Ozempic experiences - do i keep going?,"So my Endocrinologist recommended I try Ozempic once i stopped breastfeeding my youngest. That happened last year but it was ages before I could get a script. She seemed to think that if i could lose enough weight I may be able to get off medication all together. My blood glucose had been very good on 2000mg of Metformin, reduced carbohydrates and moderate exercise. But my morning readings had been creeping up. And my weight hasn't really shifted as I have a fast metabolism, so I'm always hungry and so often eating. 

I took the plunge, took Ozempic, it gave me horrible indigestion initially and after trying to increase the dose from the initial one. I've had amazing blood glucose results, i haven't been feeling very hungry at all and I've been eating much better and far less. But my weight hasn't shifted at all even after about 8 weeks. Which is extraordinarily frustrating.

Had anyone else been in this situation? Did you keep going out call quits? I feel like it's a lot if expense for just a little improvement in blood glucose results.

Long story short, instead of 75-90 mg rise, today I only had about 42 mg rise, which kept it below 180 mg, and even after my post workout meal with some carbs, it barely spiked about 180.

17rj9wl,thunder_island,Advice on ‚Äúofficially‚Äù getting diagnosed?,"I‚Äôm an American on the fringe of a type-2 diagnosis and would love a little advice. About a year ago, I started Ozempic (purely for weight loss), but insurance recently took the medical authorization away since I wasn‚Äôt diagnosed with diabetes. While on Ozempic, I lost about 20lbs, and really loved not having hunger and cravings be part of my everyday life. Now that I‚Äôve been off of it for several months, I‚Äôve gained most the weight back and am as hungry as ever. 

My PCP was looking over my BMI, family history, and some elevated non-fasting labs, and suggested I get an A1C test to see what my numbers are. My non-fasting glucose was 126, insulin was 55.3, and A1C was 5.7. My doc just sent me a message that says ‚Äúinsulin level up as is A1c and blood sugar. These together could be used to establish a diagnosis of diabetes.‚Äù

From what I‚Äôm reading, those numbers look to put me in ‚Äúprediabetes,‚Äù but guessing my doc would label it as ‚Äúdiabetes‚Äù to make me eligible for Ozempic/Mounjaro. I obviously would prefer not having either of those diagnoses, and it‚Äôs got me a bit scared. 

Here‚Äôs my actual question: would it be stupid of me to pursue/allow a ‚Äúdiabetes‚Äù diagnosis if I‚Äôm technically in ‚Äúprediabetes?‚Äù Just wondering the implications of that diagnosis as it relates to American health or life insurance, or any other things that I‚Äôm not considering. If you were in my shoes, would you just work extra hard to reduce where the numbers are, or would you accept the diagnosis to also get access to medicine that will make lifestyle changes more successful?

1eyz9pg,Available-Ad6731,Advice wanted for my upcoming Endocrinologist appointment ,"

I live in Australia. I‚Äôve been seeing this endo for two years now. Mainly for diabetes 2. He started me on Ozempic 18 months ago. I got up to the 1.5 ml shots . Then the Ozempic ran out. At that stage I had lost 10kg (I was 120kg). Because there was no Ozempic coming anytime soon he put me on  Victoza. The weight went back to 120kg, the cost was $400 a month (compared to Ozempic which was subsidised as long as it was for diabetes).
      So my endo says on my last visit when I asked him about going up from the 1mg of Ozempic he‚Äôd had me on for the last 6months, as it is not doing anything like it did before ( my diabetes numbers are ok, not brilliant. My weight will not budge, no matter how well we eat). He said the TGA (FDA in America) has said 1mg is the optimal and maximum amount for diabetes 2 in Australia. I said when we first started with Ozempic, Endo said we could go as high as 2.4mg. He flat out denied he ever said that now. My wife was sitting next to me on the call, she backed me up on what he‚Äôd said. But he wouldn‚Äôt back down from his 1mg is enough, because the TGA said so.
       Even my GP of 20 years was singing the 1 mg tune. I said that‚Äôs bullshit. I also said if you‚Äôre just doing it because there‚Äôs still a shortage here in Oz, and that‚Äôs why you‚Äôre keeping it at 1mg, so we won‚Äôt run out or have to go back onto Victoza, just say that. At least it‚Äôs an honest answer.
    But neither will budge. The endo is a belligerent POS anyway. I am pretty much bed and house bound due  to other chronic conditions. This endo has always been a zoom call. Because of the hassle to find another one and start over again just makes it problematic.
       So, my questions are firstly to other Aussie patients, has your Endo or PCD tried the 1mg is enough?
My second question is to all American patients (and any other country) what does your doctor say about the Ozempic dose? What does the FDA recommend? What is your story as far as the subject matter is concerned?

 I know I‚Äôve left out some details. So please ask/answer questions as much as you can. I zoom call him on Monday.
Depending what info I get from the Reddit community, it would help me greatly to be able to throw some facts at him.

13azmdp,broccoleeroth,Trying to understand how a high sugar/carb diet becomes T2D,"Just trying to understand this. Suppose for years someone eats a diet high in sugar and simple carbs (not hard to do in this society).  The carbs become glucose, and when it enters in the bloodstream, it triggers insulin to help it move into the cells. 

Q: which parts of the body use the most of this glucose? muscle cells? brain cells? what?

Q: why does a high sugar/carb diet trigger obesity in younger people even when their insulin secretion is still good? Is it because there is still an excess of glucose that the insulin is still not enough to get into the cells that need it and so it gets stored as fat? Or what?

Now suppose that person has reached middle age, become obese, and now insulin resistant (pre diabetes or T2)

Q: What really caused the insulin resistance?  What is it about the cells that causes them to not accept insulin to shuttle in the glucose? What was it about the obesity that caused it? 

Q: And why does it seem like so many T2D's remain obese? Is it related to the insulin resistance and/or the exogenous insulin they're taking?  Does that keep their fat stores full? Or do many maintain their high sugar/carb lifestyle despite now taking insulin?  

If there's any website that adresses many of these questions, please post a link, Thanks.

My first four month check up had me at 6.5 A1c, my weight was down 40 lb, everything was looking great. I was on Metformin IR 2000 mg per day and Jardiance 10 mg per day. Then my numbers started to climb. Each blood panel came back higher than the last one. Jardiance was increased to 25 mg, didn't make a dent. Last blood panel my A1c was 7.7. I have been eating properly, my weight has decreased even further, tho not dangerously so by any means, and my doctor and I are both confused as to what is going on.

Last month I was started on Rybelsus, the 3mg 'starter' dose. No ill effects. Two days ago it was increased to the effective 7mg dose, and that is when the trouble started. Headaches, constipation, and stomach upset -- I can't really call it nausea, more like I need a couple of really good burps! And I'm dead tired. I've had trouble moving, much less doing anything constructive. It also doesn't seem to be making much of a difference in my blood sugar.

My question is: is this going to be a permanent thing, or will the side effects fade over time?

1bzsh80,Gentei0075,Question about diabetes and Ozempic vs Rybelsus,"Hello

I was diagnosed with diabetes T2 at about 5 years ago it was managed first by regular pills as metformine and other ones I forgot.

About 2 years ago they stoped working, my GP sent me to a  endocrinologist, after some physical exams he put me on Ozempic, first 0.2 then 0.5 and then 1.0mg.  
for the first time in a long time my blood sugars dropped quickly i even had cases where my sugar droped to low were i would get a warning that it was too low.

I also lost a lot of weight.  
Then last year the problems started with availability of Ozempic (i'm from the EU)  
The doctor put me on Rybelsus 14mg (highest available dose)  
i take one pil every day on a empty stomach and wait before eating something usally a few hours.  
but since january i'm noticing my sugar levels going high again.  
the problem is that the sugar doest really drop anymore, i've done some tests on days where I don't even anything anything just drink water and they barely drop. it almost hover around the same.

at a bad day they are can be between 150-190 mg/dl and almost stay there the whole day.  
on a good day it's around 110-130 which is according to the measuring machine ok.  
And yes I watch what I eat, i do at least 30-60 mins of cardio mostly 4 times a week.

I have a appointment next month with my endocrinologist, but I already sent him a mail about this.  
his response was that Rybelsus is not as strong as Ozempic but it's kinda weird. Everywhere when you look up online for Rybelsus it's being said that it works the same as Ozempic and is a good replacment for Ozempic.  
However I seem to be hungier on Rybelsus then i was on Ozempic. 

So my question is did anyone else had this problem where they switched to Rybelsus and had a increase in their blood sugar?  
it's kinda weird that my sugar was prefectly fine under Ozempic and now  with Rybelsus it's being messed up.  
i've been using Rybelsus since october last year and it was also fine untill now january. i'm also taking Metformin along with it but I did as well for Ozempic.",3,5,2024-04-09T19:11:26,diabetes_t2,https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes_t2/comments/1bzsh80/question_about_diabetes_and_ozempic_vs_rybelsus/,1.0,True,/r/diabetes_t2/comments/1bzsh80/question_about_diabetes_and_ozempic_vs_rybelsus/

xo29mr,notreallylucy,weight loss on Mounjaro vs. Ozempic/Rybelsus,"I was on Ozempic for three (ish) years until I learned about Rybelsus. I switched to Rybelsus because it was easier for me to store and administer. I've found them both to be about equally effective.

I've lost about 45 pounds in that time. I've been working hard with diet and exercise in addition to the medication. I've hit a bit of a plateau. I'd like to lose another 20-30 pounds. I'm 5'2"",41 years old, and currently weigh 203 pounds, last a1c was 7.1, so that's a reasonable amount of weight for me to lose. 

My FIL started taking Mounjaro and has lost a lot of weight. I looked it up and it's similar to Ozempic and Rybelsus, but works on more parts of the brain. I want to know if anyone here has been on both and has found one or the other (Ozempic VS mounjaro) more effective for weight loss. I'm fortunate to have insurance where the cost for these is about the same. 

I don't want to quibble about BMI or what my weight loss goals should be - I've chosen this goals while thinking about what lifestyle will be sustainable for me long term. I plan to continue to do as much improvement as I can on diet and exercise. I'm just here to hear about people's experiences on these drugs regarding weight loss.

1n5cwvr,MedusaSteele,Advice on Food Aversion,"Hey y‚Äôall! 

Sorry if this doesn‚Äôt seem like the proper place for this, but here I go. So, I live in California and I‚Äôve now come to realize that the fires earlier in the year mentally threw me off more than I originally realized. I had to evacuate (thankfully I didn‚Äôt lose anything) and although I was with a friend and her family, it was still a mind breaking moment that made me feel unstable and isolated. Unfortunately, I‚Äôm now realizing that it set the tone for my mental state for this year: unstable and isolated.

Last year I was working out regularly, not doing too well with food, but I was trying hello fresh and factor, etc. I had an appetite for sure, and I was more balanced. This year, after what happened in January, I‚Äôve found that doing ANYTHING for myself is like Sisyphus rolling that boulder up a mountain. It‚Äôs gotten significantly worse over the months. I went from being able to eat meals to not even having the mental strength to move a prepared meal from its container to a plate just to heat it up in the microwave. It‚Äôs not that I don‚Äôt want a healthy meal, it‚Äôs that I don‚Äôt want ANY meal. Any time I force myself to eat, whether it‚Äôs a salmon dinner or idk Wendy‚Äôs, I take maybe three bites and give up. 

I find that I can snack on small things every once in a while (almonds, cubes of cheese, fruits) but rarely a full meal. Example: I‚Äôve only had applesauce today because the berries I was gonna eat had gotten old. I get the urge to eat a full meal, but I can‚Äôt get through the mental block. Obviously, this isn‚Äôt great for my body which is on Rybelsus and metformin, and I love my job, but it is high stress.

I did search this reddit for posts about food aversion, and while I found a chunk of us going through some similar situations, I wanted to see if anyone was having my specific issues and how they‚Äôve managed it? My primary care has a nutritionist, but she isn‚Äôt very helpful. Is this a situation for a nutritionist that specializes in eating disorders?

Just wanted to say that I‚Äôm in therapy, called a psychiatrist (looking into ADHD), and have an appointment with my endo in a few weeks. I know I need a medical professional, but just wanted to ask!

1n9fo4v,denotsmai83,New Caregiver Seeking Advice,"My father in law recently moved in with my wife and me. He‚Äôs a Type 2 whose previous caregiver (his wife) just wasn‚Äôt disciplined enough to help him, so his diabetes has been essentially unmanaged for a few years at least. He was hospitalized with diabetic ketoacidosis in December, which served as a brief wake up call. They put a CGM on him, but he ripped it off after a couple days and no one made him put it back on. His levels haven‚Äôt been tested since. When we got him a few days ago, we started testing the old fashioned way, and he was in the high 200‚Äôs. He has some cognitive effects from years of leaving his levels unchecked. It‚Äôs not severe, but it‚Äôs not mild either. 

We have some limited experience with the concepts of caring for a diabetic because my wife had gestational diabetes when she was pregnant. I know they aren‚Äôt the same, but the concepts of what one can and cannot eat seem pretty similar from what I‚Äôve read so far. We immediately started a more structured food plan (he‚Äôs a notorious daylong snacker who rarely ate real meals), and while he‚Äôs still running high (mid 200s fasting, between 185-220 for most other readings), we feel like we‚Äôre making progress since this is the first time his levels haven‚Äôt even been checked, much less managed. 

That said, the biggest challenge we are running into is that he is an EXTREMELY picky eater. I can count the number of non-starchy vegetables he will eat on one hand, and there are literally two fruits (apples and cantaloupe). I feel like I‚Äôm out of food ideas already and it‚Äôs only been two days. Hoping Reddit can help me with how to feed such a picky eater (also open to any other advice you can offer to a new caregiver). 

Edit: He‚Äôs on Rybelsus (7 mg) and Metformin (500 mg). Both probably worth noting. ",7,14,2025-09-06T01:41:31,diabetes_t2,https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes_t2/comments/1n9fo4v/new_caregiver_seeking_advice/,1.0,True,/r/diabetes_t2/comments/1n9fo4v/new_caregiver_seeking_advice/
1mhawl7,LadyShy75,Hoping for a new option,"When I was first diagnosed, I, like most people, was given Metformin. It gave me horrible diarrhea. So the doctor gave me the extended release Metformin. The diarrhea didn't go away.  Then I was given Glyxambi. That one was okay, but it made me pee a lot. Then I unexpectedly had to have open heart surgery, and because of the Glyxambi, I had complications and nearly died. So my doctor switched me to insulin. I take the fast acting insulin three times a day and the slow acting insulin once a day. I'm doing well on the insulin. I just hate doing the shots. They don't really hurt much, but I get bruises wherever I am give them to myself. I mostly use my stomach because it's not seen. And with four shots a day, my stomach is just covered in bruises. Plus, I hate having to carry them with me if I go anywhere in the middle of the day, and sometimes I simply forget to do it before a meal. I also stopped losing weight. I was losing whole on Metformin, but now I'm back to a BMI of 30.1. I go see my diabetes specialist tomorrow. I'm really hoping for some other type of option. Have any of you had the same issues.

1hhnegd,EarthenMama,Do doctors get kick-backs from certain companies?,"Is it possible/likely that a doctor might push certain pharmaceuticals while discouraging others for any other reasons than good medical practice? It occurs to me that mine seems to really FAVOR the Ozempic line (Ozempic, Rybelsus).

I hate to think this way, but something seems amiss. 

Editing to add: I think that this thought came to me after I considered the recommendation 2 years ago that I do a ColoGuard test instead of colonoscopy, because ""it takes so long to get an appointment"". I'm 54. I started to wonder last night if there's a benefit \*to the doctor\* to recommend ColoGuard... and put that together with the recommendation of the pill form of Ozempic even though I had not tolerated the injection.

1kgvcdr,malibubabe28,Trying to understand why hypoglycaemia is occurring,"I've been working hard on managing my T2 this year but have run into a bump in the road. I've done a lot of walking this month (1-3 hours a day). I try and walk after meals to help get my glucose down. In the last week or two I've been having hypoglycaemia episodes when I walk and feeling weak.

Pictured above is an example. I ate my dinner and had a tummy full of food. My glucose is above 8 so I set out on a walk. 20 mins into the walk my glucose crashes down to 3.6 mmol/L.

Has anyone else experienced this sort of thing, or have any insight?

I'm on metformin, Jardiance and Rybelsus.

Possible causes:
Too much exercise?
Adding GLP1 to my medication?
Recovery of insulin sensitivity due to weight loss (1 stone) leading to over medication?
Reactive hypoglycaemia to meal (meal had complex carbs but not excessive sugar)?

I just feel frustrated as I've been doing all the things I think i should be doing but struggling to walk a great distance without a crash.

1n27fu0,Complete_Artichoke60,Normal glucose levels,"Hi everyone.

I was diagnosed with type 2 in april. I got a call from the doctor after doing my yearly blood examination that I had diabetes. They would give me a call back when they made an appointment with the endocrino doctor.

Few minutes later I get a call that they made the appointment and that I can go to the hospital in 2 months time (the wait time for a specialist in Belgium is aprox 6-8 months.

30 min later another call. This time the hospital. The doctor wanted to see mee the very next day. The blood test showed my hbA1c was almost 12%.

After a few tests they told me I did not have to stay in the hospital but that I needed to start my medication the same day.

They put me on rybelsus and metformine.

So here we are today. I don‚Äôt need to monitor my sugar level all the time but because I have a fear of needles, I choose to pay for the Libre 2 out of my own pocket. I wear 1 sensor every month.

In the beginning, I used it to get to know my body. What does food do to my sugar levels? And Here is the thing. My blood levels have never gone above 140-150 after a meal. During the day it starts at around 80-100 and after a meal it almost never exceeds 130. This is after Eating anything. It could be a pizza, french Fries, Rice, potatoes, ‚Ä¶

The only thing that could make my sugar level explode are things like cookies. But I don‚Äôt eat that anyways. After reading a lot of stories I wonder if this is normal? My last hbA1c test came back 6,7%.

Before you ask, I don‚Äôt eat unhealthy every day, but I do get take out once a week. I also know that for my own health I should drink more water and eat more veggies, but I only like tomatoes, onions and salad ü•≤

I was diagnosed in 2016 and my doctors tried diet, exercise and eventually meds as a way to treat my t2. My endocrinologist has put me on all the regular meds: metformin, jardiance, rybelsus, trulicity, Amaryl.  I walk about 3 miles a day at work, and I follow ADA carb guidelines and I get my 5 a day of veggies, etc. My doctors agree to try rybelsus in late 2020 and I take it as directed, getting up to the top dose available.

The ONLY change to my regimen was this drug. My a1c went from 7.6 to 9.1. In 5.5 months. I also lost 20 lbs. But I didn't change my clothing size at all.... 20 lbs on my frame, my clothing should be falling off.
My endocrinologist had no idea why my diabetes got worse. Like that's not just a little. A lot worse. 

-

Has this happened to anyone else? 
I am beginning to see my diabetes journey is so atypical, as nearly everything I have taken does nothing, or makes my diabetes worse (or makes me so sick I can't continue past a month). My educated guess is all of my 30 lbs of med based weight loss was probably mostly muscle.

The kind with bright colors that you could barely see what was in front of you. I was alsp very clammy too. After two Japanese jelly pouches and a chocolate muscle milk I was OK. 

But what's throwing me off about all of this is I was super itchy and was having hives. Like raised skin bumps kind that itched super bad and made my skin feel like it was on fire after scratching. I thought I was having an allergic reaction to something. I had the itchy hives before but instead of feeling like a I was passing out, dizzy and spotty vision, my fingers and toes swelled up which made me think I had developed a food allergy. 

Why did that happen? I'm so confused by this. I didn't know that was a thing that could happen or even be related to sugar blood dropping or rising. 

I'm okay now, I still have some of the itches on my thighs but im home safe. 

For any other details, I do take meds. I do struggle to remember to take all of them. Today, I didn't take my levothyroxine, rybelsus and farxiga this morning. I was running late to work. I did take both doses of glipizide today. One before breakfast and one before lunch. I honestly didn't think my blood sugars were gonna drop so hard because I've known my levels to be on the higher side throughout the day.

\*\*\*\* Read on if you have time!

Hi Everyone. I'm Erik. I have a story to tell and this story is a bit long and will become part of a blog that I'm developing where I'll host more information and updates in the future. I hope that elements of my journey will help some of you with yours.

**June 2006** \- I was in the best shape of my life. I was 32 and riding 200 miles a week on my road bike. I got down to 196 lbs, which was an amazing weight for my 6'2"" frame. I rode my bike from San Francisco to Los Angeles in an annual fundraising event called the AIDS Lifecycle.

**July 2009** \- I had a physical. I was told I had metabolic disease. No hbA1C was taken. This was the last time I saw a doctor until this year. I didn't really understand what this meant and didn't do much research. I was told I had fatty liver. I just really didn't understand the gravity of the situation. I was still fooled into believing it was all about the calories -- eat less, exercise more.

**Labs**:  
**Fasting** BG: 106  
**hbA1C**: Not measured  
**TriG/TC/LDL**: 152/224/155  
**WT**: Unknown -- probably > 235

I gained more weight over the years since then and my new setpoint was around 275lbs. I exchanged my size 32/34 jeans for 38/40. My highest recorded weight was around 286 in 2015. But I avoided scales like the plague, so who knows.

I went to the doctor at various times for various reasons -- I had a panic attack in 2009 and stopped drinking caffeine. I've always had palpitations and occasionally it would trigger a panic attack that would land me in the ER only for them to tell me I was fine. I was in the ER once and they tested my BG -- 173. Doctor assumed (didn't ask) that I had eaten breakfast (I hadn't eaten in 14 hours). But I knew what this meant. I eventually bought a glucose meter on my own. 212.. 250.. 273.. sometimes 170. But never lower.

I ignored what I knew to be true. I would sometimes make an appointment with the doctor and then cancel it. I didn't want to be told I was diabetic. I just needed to eat less, exercise more. I was a glutton. It was my fault. I got into shape. I can get myself out of it by not being a fat bastard. We all see and hear this on the news -- everywhere. It's what we're all told.

I don't eat sweets -- why am I like this? Yes I probably eat too much. I should just eat less because it's all about the calories, right? That's what society tells us. Eat less, exercise more. Simple!

**February 2022** \-- I developed appendicitis. At the hospital, BG was 273. I hadn't eaten for 3 days! I'm going to die. No one at the hospital said shit to me. But I knew what it meant. I had stopped testing my own BG 2 years earlier -- why? I knew what I had and what it meant. I didn't want to be on insulin (I thought everyone who was diabetic had to take insulin.. I was ignorant).

**August 11, 2022** \- I worked up the courage to finally go to the doctor. I didn't tell my husband. I had probably disappointed him by canceling doctors visits he would setup for me. Honestly we never spoke about health -- he's fluctuated up and down, but at 6'3"", he's always been reasonably fit. But I am going to die. I am going to lose my feet, my kidneys. I'm going to leave the person that I have loved dearly for 17 years. I'm not ready to go. I have to do this. I have to face this.

**Fasting** BG: 309  
**hbA1C**: 10.6

**WT**: 263.3lbs (Starting weight)

My doctor took a dump. Metformin was ordered that day (1G x daily). I had a follow up scheduled in a month, but we bumped that up to the following week.

**August 22, 2022** \- New doctor (I go to a teaching clinic and I think my R2 was over his head). She put me on 3mg Rybelsus. BG was coming down, but my fasting BG was still around 170 and I was spiking up to 270 if I ate the wrong thing. I had dusted off my old BG meter I bought in 2018 and was using that 4-6 times a day.

**WT**: 260.8 (-2.5 lbs / -1%)

**September 15, 2022** \- New doctor. BG was down to 140 but not lower. I was crapping myself all the time (metformin). Since the previous visit, I started researching Rybelsus and GLP-1RA drugs in general. I came across Mounjaro and really liked the idea of a once-weekly injection. I didn't like having to take Rybelsus, wait 30-60 minutes, take my next medication or get coffee, etc. And I wasn't seeing the results. So I asked my doctor about this and he put me on 5mg MJ and away I went on my journey with you guys! BTW, I had come in with exactly what I wanted in terms of dose and asked to start at 5mg.

**WT**: 256.6 (-6.7 lbs / -2.5%)

My weight and BG began dropping within 2 days. My fasting BG dropped from 140 to under 100.

**October 14, 2022** \- New doctor. Just a check in. All good.

14r5ugi,DiabeticPissingSyrup,Catastrophically bad idea. Wish me luck.,"I'm sure this post needs a warning that this is a BadIdea‚Ñ¢ but I'm giving up on good ideas.

Since November Ozempic has been impossible to get hold of reliably in the UK. I know it's bad worldwide, but the NHS has told doctors that it's going to be AWOL for another 6-12 months since the only supplies coming in to the UK are getting snapped up by private clinics giving it to people who want to lose weight.

Rybelsus (or however it's spelt) has gone the same way. Victoza (which worked but had side effects for me and my shitty schedule) has now gone onto a protected list and they aren't allowed to put new patients on it.

My only options are a pill you need to take 20 minutes before food (good luck mixing that with ADHD), one that's pretty much guaranteed to give me thrush, one that will fuck me up if I don't drink enough (which I never do, hello ADHD), or insulin. Which I'm told will put weight on.

So, I've told the Dr to stuff it. If they can't do healthy treatments, I don't see why I should either.

Aside : my wife is seriously overweight and pre-diabetic, and has been put on a hospital diet that involved nothing but milk or fortisip, a vitamin supplement, and a salt supplement. She's lost significant weight on it and is now having solid food reintroduced, apparently as a keto style diet.

Back to the insanity: so... Fuck it. I'm going for intermittent fasting. One day of keto and two of a milk diet.

I need to upgrade my finger prick to a machine that monitors ketones too, but I'm going to give this a try.

I've already been told by drs that I ""just need to lose 15% to see things turn around"" but I'm already down from 154kg to low 120s which is 20% and just got a 72 HbA1C. Let's see what happens if I get to 100kg. That would give me a BMI of 28, so still ""overweight"" on this stupid bloody scale.

I guess this will either be a fun journey or a lesson in how not to treat diabetes. Let's see what happens.",15,32,2023-07-05T15:11:24,diabetes_t2,https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes_t2/comments/14r5ugi/catastrophically_bad_idea_wish_me_luck/,1.0,True,/r/diabetes_t2/comments/14r5ugi/catastrophically_bad_idea_wish_me_luck/

162eybn,kchamplin,What has taking insulin been like?,"I was diagnosed with type 2 about 12 years ago. I'm a skinny diabetic and have dealt with my condition by eating low carb, but I have continued to lose weight (I'm 5'10"" and I used to weight somewhere between 120-130, I now fluctuated between 114-116) and after wearing a continuous glucose monitor for a month or two it seems like my numbers spend most of the day in the 200-250 range.  At the last appointment with my endo he said something like ""You want to avoid insulin for as long as possible, correct?"" to which I said yes. So he prescribed Rybelsus, which I'm not taking because of my concern about losing more weight (it has a tendency to suppress one's appetite).

The last appointment I had with my endo was a tele-medicine appointment, and because he probably has an old laptop or something I couldn't hear him at all (won't do that again, he wasn't able to fix the sound issue after raising it with him), I couldn't ask questions, I didn't understand everything he said, and he didn't see me to emphasize how skinny I am.  (In his defense he had called my cellphone and had suggested I call him if I had any questions. I should have called him, but just didn't feel comfortable doint that.)

My impression is my endo thinks insulin is probably worth trying and so I've been mentally preparing myself to start given that 1) it will likely help me gain weight, and 2) it will probably bring my numbers down, 3) I will hopefully be able to eat with a bit more variety.

From what I've read, and based on past conversations with my primary doctor, he's likely to start me on a daily longer-lasting insulin. But I've also read that the most effective treatment will require fast-acting insulin required for meals, especially if I'm eating carbs occasionally.  (For what it's worth I've asked to be tested for Type1.5/LADA and I don't appear to have it.)

For those who treat their Type 2 with insulin, especially those that use fast-acting insulin for their meals, 1) how difficult have you found it to adjust to using insulin in order to improve your numbers while not going hypo? 2) Do you find you must stick to similar meals in order to get more predictable behavior from your insulin doses?  3) Has taking insulin made you feel better or worse, given you more or less energy?

For a skinny person I actually do a lot of emotionally eating, so I've thought about going to therapy to try to treat that, and I could still try doing intermittent fasting/time-restricted eating which I've done some very light dabbling in and have seen some positive results, but it does put a downward pressure on one's weight.",6,14,2023-08-27T08:38:35,diabetes_t2,https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes_t2/comments/162eybn/what_has_taking_insulin_been_like/,0.88,True,/r/diabetes_t2/comments/162eybn/what_has_taking_insulin_been_like/
162dl4i,whatanerdgirlsays,I'm Celebrating,"Originally diagnosed in 2018, with an A1c of 11.7. Got down to 5.6 in 2019. Pandemic messes me up and I lost control of my diet and exercise and taking my meds and all of that. Went right back up to 10.6 in July of last year.

In May, I was taken in an ambulance to the ER from work with a kidney stone and when they tested my blood sugar, of course, and I was 415. The ER doctor did NOT hold back. He told me I was too young for these problems (I'm 35) and that I needed to get my act together.

Since May, I've been back on Metformin and my doctor put me on Rybelsus as well, which I really like. I have changed my diet and I'm back to exercising regularly. I was tested in June and my A1c was 7.1, which was a vast vast improvement 

I just tested again a few days ago and I'm down to 5.3. I'm super stoked and like...really proud of myself. I've been working my ass off the last four months. Making sure to take all my meds, exercising, eating right...it's not always easy and I'm kicking ass. And my family doesn't care.

14d2dyj,Monzoles,What Kind of Food is Easy to Digest?,"So two months ago, I got a new doctor who decided to put me on Trulicity to manage A1C and, after an experience I thought was too unnatural for someone on Trulicity (vomiting two days in a row, real bad diarrhea, I swear I felt chest pains as well during that week) my doctor instead put me on Rybelsus. Now it's been a month so far on this stuff and, while things are slightly better, I still suffer vomiting which, annoyingly happens almost TWELVE hours after I eat.

I have diabetics in my family telling me I'll get over this or that I just have to eat less and I don't know how less is less since I already skip all but one meal of the day/am starting to be SCARED to eat food at all. I hate how my stomach just won't settle down ever since going on this medicine and I want it to stop fully! I looked up food that apparently I have to avoid while on Rybelsus and that seems to be everything that I used to eat whereas the food it wants me to eat is food that's gonna make me sick anyways. So now I'm just wondering if there's any specific food that shouldn't take long to digest, like names of food, not 'things with fat,' or, 'things with glucose,' I need words like, 'pretzels,' or 'apple.'

165ova3,Shellseys,I‚Äôm really struggling,"Hello, I (32 F) was diagnosed type 2 last October. The first few months, it seemed it was controlled with metformin, diet and exercise. Then, my A1C shot up to 10.2. I was shocked, as I‚Äôd lost about 30 lbs and was barely overweight at that point. My primary added Rybelsus, and I‚Äôm on 7MG with 1000 mg of metformin. It seemed to help a little bit, though my fasting sugars steadily became out of control. Now, I‚Äôm a normal weight, and I can barely have ANY carbohydrate at all, even when I pair it with a protein. My fasting sugars are over 200 (today, it was 309) my doctor doesn‚Äôt even seem concerned, and added Glimpirade 4MG to take with the Rybelsus and metformin. I feel so defeated. When I was first diagnosed, I decided to try my best to come off the medication. I went to a dietitian, and I changed everything, losing the 50 lbs I needed to lose to be a healthy weight. But the changes don‚Äôt seem to have ultimately mattered, because I can‚Äôt control my sugar, and I said enough and asked for an endocrinologist referral. My appointment isn‚Äôt until September 25th, and I‚Äôm desperately trying to lower my sugars until then, and I‚Äôm hoping being on 3 medications will take my sugars out of the 300‚Äôs. I‚Äôve talked to a few nurses I know, and they told me about LADA diabetes. I seem to fit, but it‚Äôs like the more time that passes, the more control I lose and the more medication I need. I haven‚Äôt even been diabetic for a full year! 

I suppose I wanted to know if anyone else has had a similar experience? Thank you for reading! <3

I‚Äôve dropped 11 kilos (around 24lbs I think, a long way to go still)  and my glucose readings are pretty stable, between 5.7 and 6.0 mmo/l usually (I test first thing, before evening meal and two hours after first bite). I take Metformin 500 morning and night and 7mg Rybelsus. 

Tonight I came home from work and my husband had made dinner for the rest of the family - Swedish meatballs, mashed potatoes and ‚Äúgr√§dds√•s‚Äù (kind of a creamy gravy thing - Swedish). I was going to have a few meatballs with veg but I really fancied the mash. So I had maybe 3 heaped tablespoons of mash, 6 meatballs and some sugar snap peas, followed by a few spoonfuls of flavored quark (0.2% sugar) Two hours later my glucose reads at 5.7, the same as it was before dinner.  How??? Surely it should have spiked with the carbs? Usually I see post dinner readings around 6.5- 7.5/8 but this seemed perfect! Am I really that in control already that I can eat potatoes?  

I feel very confused. I  trying my hardest to take this disease seriously after years of putting off dieting and getting healthy, but it almost seems too easy to stray off plan if there are no consequences‚Ä¶and given that I‚Äôve sabotaged every diet I‚Äôve been in before I‚Äôm worried with results like these I‚Äôll do it again. And then tell myself that I‚Äôll fix it with a couple of months dieting here and there. My stupid brain is even trying to convince me that I was misdiagnosed and these readings prove it.  I‚Äôd rather see more consequences on the monitor to my decisions to be honest!

17b9y64,NBAY001,long time Type II,"Hi, I was diagnosed in 2011 with Pre-diabetes.  I generally have a low carb diet but over the years that has waxed and waned.  But I don't eat processed food, sugar, bread, etc.  Basically over time my A1C has inched it's way up to over 6.  I have been taking Metformin, 500 mg for quite a few years with no side effects.  I want to stop the rising A1C.  I don't have access to an Endo in my area, there is a shortage for some reason.  There are only 2 available for 100 miles and they stick to Type I issues.   So, I am kind of on my own for now.  My primary suggested Rybelsus and I tried it but it was pure awful.  After a month I stopped.  But in the end, it seems to me I should increase my Metformin.  I am 67 years old, exercise a lot, eat fairly well, and I am wondering if bumping it up to 1000mg or more would make a big dent in my numbers.  I am tired of constant low carb.

1064941,Library_IT_guy,I'm in shock. Fasting bg of 300 last year. My highest during the day is now 140.,"It was a long year for me and it sucked. Diagnosed last November with fasting bg of 300. I ended my fast with a bowl of jambalaya and skyrocketted to 450 and had a trip to the ER. Getting used to 1500mg of metformin was awful. Glimepiride is a miracle drug - zero side effects, absolutely works. Gabapentin may have saved my life. I don't know how much longer I could have lived with neuropathy. 

All of that plus diet changes and daily walks got me to 6.5 a1c, down from 13. Then I started eating poorly again and shot back up to 10. Glimepiride increased and started on Rybelsus. First few weeks of Rybelsus was as bad, maybe worse than first month of metformin, but it's getting better. I'm near the end of the  4mg period and I'll go to a higher dose soon. 

But it's working. I took my bg level last night 2 hours after eating, and I was only at 100. I'm still in shock. 130 this morning, when I tend to be the worst. I'm starting to realize, I CAN do this. And I don't have to be miserable. I can still have some carbs. I can eat chili with some beans in it. I can have that slice of cornbread. Just not as much as I used to eat. And with being on Rybelsus... I don't want more! My stomach no longer feels like a bottomless pit. I have a normal person sized serving and I'm full! The thought of eating more is repulsive. Is this how normal people feel?! All of my life, I've noticed others around me being satisfied when eating less. Even as a young child, I remember asking for seconds regularly when my cousins and friends did not want more. People would say I just liked eating more than other kids. I just had a bigger stomach. No. My stomach just lacked the off switch others had. 

This has been kind of a ramble. I guess I'm just saying that if you are struggling, if you're like I was for all of 2022, know that there is hope. It takes time to get the meds right. You'll need to make some lifestyle changes. But you don't have to be miserable or perfect.",51,11,2023-01-08T05:46:02,diabetes_t2,https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes_t2/comments/1064941/im_in_shock_fasting_bg_of_300_last_year_my/,0.98,True,/r/diabetes_t2/comments/1064941/im_in_shock_fasting_bg_of_300_last_year_my/

For instance, last night my blood sugars were 126 before going to bed.  At midnight they started rising all the way up to 190 when I was awake.  This has happened several times and I can't figure out why.

15uegnf,TBatrics,Lower Sugars and Sleep Issues,"So it's 3:15am and I have not slept, despite turning in around 10:30pm. Part of this is related to nausea I associate with my Rybelsus increase (just a guess), but I also noticed my Libre showed a pretty heavy drop in glucose around 10pm, and it continued down until 2:45am. At that point I got up and had a snack to try and maintain levels. 

My glucose tends to be around 150-180 (not good but truth). When I got up it was about 75. Because I know higher levels leaf to fatigue for me I just wondered if these lower levels might be making rest more difficult. 

Figured I'd ask since I don't seem to be sleeping anytime soon, lol.",4,5,2023-08-18T13:52:28,diabetes_t2,https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes_t2/comments/15uegnf/lower_sugars_and_sleep_issues/,1.0,True,/r/diabetes_t2/comments/15uegnf/lower_sugars_and_sleep_issues/

12534j1,TBatrics,Faltering treatment,"So awhile back I was on Metformin and Ozempic, and my a1c and sugars were good. Then I started to get sick and began vomiting  daily. Doctor suspected the Ozempic, and moving off it seemed to solve that issue. 

Problem is, ever since then my blood sugar has been 250-450 every time I check it. A1c was 9.7 last week. I have been on Jardiance, some injectable time release insulin, as replacements. I have maintained Metformin throughout.

The current plan is Metformin, the injectable, and Rybelsus.  It's been frustrating, and I hope Rybelsus will turn the tide back.",0,5,2023-03-29T03:03:18,diabetes_t2,https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes_t2/comments/12534j1/faltering_treatment/,0.5,True,/r/diabetes_t2/comments/12534j1/faltering_treatment/
vfh9eu,Lost-Cc,T2 Freak?,"Greetings. I was diagnosed in 2017 after 5 years of undiagnosed IBS-D with an a1c of 6.8 after controlling with diet best to my abilities with non-FODMAP aggravating foods, and walking 4 miles every day at work, my diabetes has worsened continually. 

I have been on: metformin extended release, jardiance, rybelsus, Amaryl, trulicity and now I start Ozembic next week. I have had to stop many of these meds and try another due to the side effects of diarrhea or nausea, or limb numbness being so severe. Zofran does work for nausea, but not enough for me to function daily.

Not one of these meds has lowered my a1c. Rybelsus and trulicity did decrease my hunger, and I lost weight without trying, but the glycogen/ insulin output didn't seem to do jack or shit. During the 6 months of rybelsus I lost 20 lbs, but my a1c went from 7.6 to 9.1. My a1c is now 9.5.
My comprehensive blood, liver and kidney tests are always within normal ranges, every 6 months. My thyroid with t3 t4 is normal, cortisol was just checked and that's normal too. My diet and exercise have not changed. The only increased stress would be working during the pandemic in my lab job with no big breaks of rest. I work 40 hrs a week and I live alone, this has also been constant for 5 years.

Am I a freak in this category (?) I can't find any info about diabetes drugs not working *at all* on a1c and glucose, just people finding they stop working as well as they used to. Am I just doomed to insulin or WTF? Any ideas?

He was diagnosed in late July and has been on 1500mg ER Metformin and just started Rybelsus this week, too. He's been checking his blood glucose first thing in the morning and then again before dinner. In the morning he's averaging around 150. Before dinner he's averaging around 105-110.

Within minutes I got lightheaded and my heart started racing. I checked my glucose, it had spiked to 130. I'd just eaten so that makes senee, right. Why do I feel so terrible? It happens pretty regularly after breakfast and the numbers about the same.
