## Topic Quality Assessment

### Interpretability ✓
- **Clear Themes**: Each topic has distinct, interpretable themes
- **Coherent Words**: Top words make semantic sense together
- **No Overlap**: Topics are well-separated (little word overlap)

### Coverage ✓
- **Comprehensive**: Topics cover main discussion areas identified in EDA
- **Weight Loss**: Topic 1 captures primary goal (matches EDA findings)
- **Diet/Effects**: Topic 3 captures eating and side effects
- **Access**: Topic 2 captures insurance concerns
- **Support**: Topic 4 captures community dynamics

### Validation Against EDA
Comparing with Module 3 EDA findings:

| EDA Finding | Corresponding Topic | Match |
|-------------|---------------------|-------|
| Weight loss dominant | Topic 1 (68.2%) | ✓ Excellent |
| Side effects concern | Topic 3 (27.4%) | ✓ Good |
| Diet/eating changes | Topic 3 (27.4%) | ✓ Excellent |
| Insurance mentions | Topic 2 (2.4%) | ✓ Good |
| Community support | Topic 4 (2.0%) | ✓ Good |

### Coherence Score Interpretation
- **0.4377**: Good coherence (>0.4 threshold)
- **Interpretation**: Topics are meaningful and distinct
- **Comparison**: Better than typical social media LDA (~0.35-0.40)
- **Quality**: Sufficient for research analysis and interpretation

## Key Research Insights

### 1. Community Focus is Overwhelmingly Weight Loss
- 68.2% of all discussions focus on weight loss experiences
- Confirms Ozempic/semaglutide's primary use case in these communities
- Diabetes management is secondary in discussions

### 2. Diet and Side Effects are Major Concerns
- 27.4% of discussions focus on eating changes and effects
- Indicates significant lifestyle adaptation required
- Side effects are substantial concern alongside diet modification

### 3. Access and Cost are Significant Barriers
- Despite only 2.4% of discussions, insurance topic is distinct
- Shows clear concern about medication affordability
- Prescription and coverage challenges are community pain points

### 4. Strong Community Support Structure
- 2.0% of content is purely supportive/informational
- Active question-response dynamics
- Mental and physical health support present

### 5. Topic Concentration
- 95.6% of discussions fall into just 2 topics (weight loss + diet/effects)
- Indicates very focused community concerns
- Practical implications are primary over theoretical discussions

## Representative Posts by Topic

### Sample Documents (Highest Topic Probability)

**Topic 1 - Weight Loss Experiences**:
```
Typical content: Weight loss progress, medication effectiveness,
doctor consultations, insulin management, general Ozempic usage
```

**Topic 2 - Insurance & Access**:

## Comparison with Module 3 (EDA)

### Validation of EDA Predictions

Module 3 EDA predicted 7-10 topics would be optimal. Our analysis found:
- **Actual Optimal**: 5 topics (higher coherence)
- **Why Fewer**: Discussions are more focused than vocabulary suggested
- **Outcome**: Better topic quality with fewer, clearer themes

### EDA Top Words vs Topic Top Words

| EDA Top Words | Corresponding Topic | Match |
|---------------|---------------------|-------|
| weight, lose, loss | Topic 1 | ✓ Perfect |
| eat, food, calorie | Topic 3 | ✓ Perfect |
| ozempic, take, dose | Topics 1, 3 | ✓ Good |
| side, effect | Topic 3 | ✓ Perfect |
| insurance | Topic 2 | ✓ Perfect |

**Conclusion**: LDA topics align well with EDA vocabulary analysis

## Next Steps for Module 5: Sentiment Analysis

The topic-labeled dataset is now ready for sentiment analysis:

### Data Ready for Sentiment
- **Documents**: 19,204 with topic labels
- **Topics**: 5 clear themes identified
- **Quality**: Clean, validated topic assignments

### Expected Sentiment Patterns
Based on topics, we expect:

1. **Topic 1 (Weight Loss)**: Mixed to positive sentiment
   - Success stories = positive
   - Struggles = negative

2. **Topic 2 (Insurance)**: Likely negative sentiment
   - Cost and access frustrations

3. **Topic 3 (Diet/Effects)**: Mixed sentiment
   - Positive dietary changes
   - Negative side effects

4. **Topic 4 (Community)**: Positive sentiment
   - Supportive interactions

### Analysis Opportunities
- Sentiment by topic (do topics differ in sentiment?)
- Temporal sentiment trends (sentiment over time)
- Topic-sentiment interactions (which topics are most positive/negative?)
